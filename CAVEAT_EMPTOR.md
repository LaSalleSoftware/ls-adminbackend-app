My LaSalle Software is licensed under the MIT License, mostly because the Laravel Framework and third party packages made to work with Laravel Framework are under the MIT License. 

Generally, MIT is considered the most permissive of the open source licenses. It certainly is rather sparse in its wording.

There is a wonderful blog post called [The MIT License, Line by Line -- 171 words every programmer should understand](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2016/09/21/MIT-License-Line-by-Line.html).

However, my heart is probably more with the GPLv3 license. Most famously, this is the open source license WordPress uses.
