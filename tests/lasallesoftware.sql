My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Tuesday, November 10th, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My 52nd episode was back in April 2012. I took a hiatus at the time to focus on developing my LaSalleMart ecommerce extension for&nbsp;Joomla. I continued publishing my &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcasts, all 37 of them. But, I am glad to be back to publishing two separate podcasts, one strictly about my software and the other for broader discussions and interviews.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much to talk about, but there is one over arching thing I want to focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to get you into web applications!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The economics of web apps has changed. A sea change, over the last few years. Getting into web apps is accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technical changes&nbsp;driving the economic change:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>git and GitHub.com</li>\r\n	<li>Composer</li>\r\n	<li>cloud servers</li>\r\n	<li>continuous technologies</li>\r\n	<li>Laravel Framework&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You had to be a start up, or a well funded project, to do web applications. Now, people that are doing medium to high-ish end Joomla or WordPress sites can get do web applications instead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>not for the feint of heart</li>\r\n	<li>it is technology laden -- because that&#39;s where the value is!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology is progressing from pure infrastructure to the individual web app itself. It&#39;s akin to the oil business&#39; &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot;. Without the &quot;upstream&quot; infrastructure, there&#39;s no &quot;downstream&quot;. Now, we are in a multi-year phase of seeing a build-up of downstream technologies. Right now, it is still raw. Different ideas are coming out how to get you into web apps fast and cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am on the forefront of this downstream focus! My idea is to get your web app spun up on your own cloud server, by providing ready-made scaffolding. Where content, user management, authorization, access control, a back-end, and other basic goodies, exist in a ready-to-install fashion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This scaffolding does not yet exist, but not for long. The Laravel Framework founder is now working on a dual scaffolding: for&nbsp;software-as-a-service; and, for self-hosted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a large gap between the upstream and downstream web app technologies, because the technologies had to progress linearly towards downstream. Downstream&#39;s time has come, and I am in the thick of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Amazon Web Services <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5-ifl7KJ00\" target=\"_blank\">Reinvent 2015 keynote </a>is indicative that we are in the downstream phase now, as it focused on services more than infrastructure.

(97, 3, 3, 'LaSalle Software News #2: Polishing Up', 'lasallesoftwarenews2', '<p>[Please note: This looks like a transcript, but it is not a transcript!]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to my second&nbsp;LaSalle Software News podcast. This&nbsp;podcast is published at the top of the month updating you on what is happening with&nbsp;my LaSalle Software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, coming to you from Toronto, Canada. Today is Tuesday, December 1st, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DIY Scaffolding Turned Into LaSalle Software</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I decided to get into doing real web applications based on the superbly fabulous Laravel Framework in the spring of 2014, I could not find any satisfactory web app scaffolding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software that had a built-in blog, login management, user management, permissions management, administrative back-end; and, a bunch of other accroutements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I built my own, which turned into something a lot more comprehensive and wonderful. What I now call LaSalle Software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>November was an Incredible Month!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, November, was an incredible month. A most enjoyable month, using my own LaSalle Software myself, for my own business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I released Version 1.0 last month; and, deployed my own six web apps based on LaSalle Software last month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been a long time coming, and finally the day has arrived it is all released and deployed for real. It feels great!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I especially enjoy&nbsp;understanding the database. You laugh, but I have had to reverse engineer mangled database tables much too often since freelancing. There is a lot of very fine discussion about mangled coding. But not a lot of discussion about constructing sane databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mangled databases&nbsp;cost clients lots of money, money down the drain. Mangled databases inexorably lead to mangled coding. I have invoiced for&nbsp;expedient mangled work-arounds quite a lot. Not insignificantly due to purposefully mangled databases and coding for the express intent of making code indecipherable, lest someone repackage and redistribute said open source software for a cheaper price.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quoting Oracle&#39;s wiki, &quot;Normalization is a ... database design [made] for efficient access and storage of data. These steps reduce data redundancy and the chances of data becoming inconsistent&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a uniform way of naming fields. For example, the primary indexed field is called &quot;id&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have standard handling for lookup tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My database is normalized, with a uniform structure; and, is generally sane and follow-able.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I especially enjoy understanding my front-end design, and being able to modify it at will. Over the years, ready made templates and themes for WordPress and Joomla have become incredibly bloated, to the point where it is a major exercise making changes Not to start a rant here, and not getting into the what&#39;s and why&#39;s, so suffice to say that it has been an absolute pleasure being able to change anything and everything on my front-end template with minimal fuss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As great an achievement releasing version 1.0 and deploying my own web apps, using my stuff for real is itself a starting point. No surprise that it did not take long to start a wish-list of features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>LaSalle Software Development has Settled Down&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software development has settled down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going through my 150+ original&nbsp;blog entries, it&#39;s pretty clear that the backward incompatible Joomla versions; moving to web application based on the Laravel Framework; and, doing a re-write when Laravel released version 5.1 Long Term Support version took a heavy toll on doing stable software development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, things have settled down profoundly. Things are pretty sane, now. LaSalle Software Version 1.0 is released. It needs some polishing up, which will be released as Version 1.01 by Christmas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software Version 1.01 is a pretty serious, comprehensive, basis for building custom web applications within sane timeframes at sane prices. Pretty much what I set out to achieve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Version 1.01 Fixes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Without explaining what these things are, here are the major things&nbsp;I&#39;m working on for Version 1.01. It&#39;s all on GitHub.com:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>remove the javascript confirmation modal box for record deletions -- add&nbsp;a new custom blade file instead</li>\r\n	<li>fix pivot table deletion omission</li>\r\n	<li>add a new &quot;apply changes&quot; button to admin form automation</li>\r\n	<li>modify default listing to 100 records by ID descending</li>\r\n	<li>a new file upload/media manager</li>\r\n	<li>simple, but needed, refactor of the admin API&#39;s baserepository.php</li>\r\n	<li>add Elixir 4.0, and refactor front-end and admin for Elixir 3.0, font awesome, among other things</li>\r\n	<li>round out user management, access control, and login management</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2016 is the Year of LaSalleMart Development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no doubt that 2016 will be the year of developing ecommerce software. Which, I have to tell you, I think in a way is absolutely insane, because there is so much ecommerce software out there. Well, a funny thing abou that... there is a lot of ecommerce software out there, but not a lot of Laravel ecommerce software. I suspect there is a lot of Laravel ecommerce software development out there, but for in-house only. It seems that each week brings yet another software-as-a-service ecommerce solution, but that is not really what I want.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a prelude to developing LaSalleMart:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I will deep dive, finally, into unit and integration -- and whatever else -- testing</li>\r\n	<li>I have started to learn the Vue javascript language</li>\r\n	<li>I am in the midst of learning about API development, the scope of which has taken me by surprise</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lumen - Mandrill Email Microservice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The one thing I want to squeeze in, a pet project over the holidays, is setting up an email service using Laravel&#39;s Lumen microframework, in conjunction with Mandrill. Basically, I want to get inbound and outbound email working within a web app. I could use this for my podcasting web app. As well, it would be great to get contact forms to send emails to the app, as part of customer management. You can see why I invested effort into setting up the basic packages for CRM software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On My Flagship Site...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On my flagship site, I have a page enumerating detailed features of LaSalle Software. As well, I published two screencasts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

This release is the first version of my Software that I am confident in installing for clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the first major release after tagging version 1.0 in November. Since that release, I have live deployed six of my own LaSalle Software web applications on Digital Ocean servers, using the Laravel &quot;Forge&quot; service. My web apps&nbsp;have performed well and are stable. I have smoothed out many rough edges, and have added more features such as Two Factor Authorization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software was originally intended to be scaffolding software, to give my clients a head start when building their custom web apps. It is not scaffolding, it is a full fledged content system with user management, login/logout/registration handling, 2FA, a full admin back-end, and&nbsp;admin form automation to speed up custom development. There are optional apps, such as a to-do app, and a customer database app, that can be installed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is comprised of composer installable packages. Some packages are mandatory, and some are optional.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software uses PSR-4, abides by PSR-2 coding standards (mostly), uses composer for package installation, and integrates a number of fine third party packages for the site map, image handling, and backups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emphatically, there are&nbsp;no proprietary modules, nor proprietary templating schemes. The point is to stick with&nbsp;the growing composer-installable package libraries;&nbsp;and, with the Laravel eco-systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software includes a content system, which includes micro-tags, meta-tags (still need the meta-descripton for search results),&nbsp;unlimited tags, the option to create static pages, built-in image handling, future dated publishing, and a bunch of other stuff I can&#39;t remember.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you have to do is build a front-end, because I do not have pre-built templates. Which I do on purpose, because low to mid budget sites under-invest in their front-ends. At least in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to create web application software that got my clients over the last hump. Web app server and deployment costs have come down like a rock; and, that techology has improved by leaps and bounds over the last few years. The Laravel Framework is a superb, modern, web application framework with which to base our web apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was missing was the basic software that everyone needs as the basis for their own custom web applications. I want to provide that software to you, the software that has the basic content management, the basic user management, the basic login authentication -- essentially, the necessary software scaffolding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scaffolding that I wanted did not exist. So I built my own. Which became a lot more than simple scaffolding. The features are more fully built-out than what basic scaffolding provides. My clients have quite a head start now with their custom web app development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, web app development is accessible to those who would otherwise use WordPress or similar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is not feature complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a glaring inability to search the server for existing images to use. I assumed that such a package exists, but I have not found this package; nor, have I built this package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My administrative back-end lacks the javascript candy that people have come to expect. For which I am unapologetic!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are&nbsp;no access control levels beyond that you have to be a &quot;Super Administrator&quot; to log into the back-end. The scope of ACL development has increased so much that I have left its development for after v1.01&#39;s release.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is designed to bring out the value of custom web app development. It provides a solid footing for further custom development, saving my clients five (or six?!) figures not having to conjure up the base feature set that everyone needs for their web apps themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am thrilled to announce that I am building a volunteer proof-of-concept web application for my synagogue. It will be a live test-bed for software I was going to develop anyways, but now that there is a real web app the quality of the software will increase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later this month, I will start LaSalleMart API development. This ecommerce API will be a real API, not just an internal API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will use RAML and MuleSoft tools to build my API.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a series of articles about this major LaSalle Software release.

Joomla version changes were obsoleting my Joomla ecommerce extensions, ruining my ability to achieve a return on significant investment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided that my new technical specialty would be the Laravel Framework, an up-and-coming web application framework for the PHP programming language. Good decision! But, boy... what a journey of learning it was, and is. My technical skills have vaulted by orders of magnitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It did not take long to realize that I was going to need some type of ready-made content system, along with a few other accroutements. The Framework does not provide this, by design. After searching for the right project that offers the web app basics that all projects need, I decided to create my own software. At the time, I was programming my own little blog, just to learn Laravel. Well, this little blog turned into my LaSalle Software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early November 2015, I released version 1.0. At the same time, I live deployed six of my own web applications: my Flagship web app, this podcasting web app, and four one page web apps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2016, I released my first ever &quot;client-ready&quot; LaSalle Software version (version 1.0.1). I ironed out some rough edges, and added a few features, One of the more notable features I added was two factor authentication.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first client is a volunteer proof-of-concept web app -- my synagogue. There will be more rough edges to smooth out, as people other than me will use my Software for the first time. The goals are very ambitious. Two notable packages that will come from this project are the Event package; and, the Granular Access Control Levels pacakge. These packages will be released as FOSS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just might have my first paid LaSalle Software engagement this month. It&#39;s not finalized, and maybe it will not happen. But, it&#39;s notable that LaSalle Software is at the point where paid engagements are contemplated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a very good progression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I created six new packages ahead of creating the base proof-of-concept web app. Which brings me to almost two dozen Composer-installable FOSS packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A candle lighting package, a service times package, an enhanced contact form package, a list of installed LaSalle Software packages, an SMS package, and an events package.&nbsp;The enhanced contact form package will grab contact info from my customer database, even though there will not be any customers, the customer database is a great place to keep employee and executive data for display in various spots throughout the app. All packages will be done by mid-March, except the events package which has a bigger scope so it will take time to develop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m none to happy with MailChimp&#39;s sudden announcement to get out of the free Mandrill business. The suddenness is, in my opinion, out of character. Their announcement included the suggestion that those seeking a low-cost alternative for transactional email look at Amazon&#39;s Simple Email Service. I will take them up on their suggestion because the more I use Amazon&#39;s web services, the more I will learn it; and, AWS&nbsp;is broadening its email offerings in general.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to learn Amazon Web Services as much as I can by actually using it. So I will be doing just that -- switching into AWS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one exception may be Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) because Digital Ocean so far seems like the better deal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that people other than me will be using LaSalle Software, there&#39;s going to be a period of smoothing out the rough edges other people see that I do not see, or that really do not bother me. An example are errors that halt a web app. I actually prefer to see the raw message; but, these error messages are not very helpful in general and they are very dire looking. So I&#39;ll need custom error messages for things like PDO Cannot Connect to Database and Token Mismatch errors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve been pondering my version numbering. My &quot;client-ready&quot; release should be version &quot;1.1.0&quot; instead of &quot;1.0.1&quot;. To make matters worse, I marked this version as &quot;1.01&quot; in a lot of packages. Oops. Hopefully, the SemVer gods will shine a bright countenance on me nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next major (backward-compatible) LaSalle Software release shall be crowned &quot;1.2.0&quot; to get back on track.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a back-log -- it does not take much to get behind, with all that is happening. This week, the first week of March I will take care of this back-log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My back-log does include some new things that I want to do before I start my new things in earnest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will wrap up my half-dozen packages, which are all small and do-able.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will modify my Flagship site&#39;s home page, in the hopes of getting across what LaSalle Software is all about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will switch my web apps to SES and EC2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a few other things.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, I am blocking out a couple of days to go through Laracast&#39;s testing series, and to go through MuleSoft&#39;s tools for LaSalleMart&#39;s API, because I need to kick-off LaSalleMart development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, I have the proof-of-concept&#39;s initial deployment (on EC2!) to do. And, we&#39;ll see about the new engagment in the works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, my granular permissions package.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy a good, profitable month!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

I built custom features based on my experience producing successful interviews in my pre-Laravel Framework era.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have an entire web application, lovingly built with my custom podcasting software, to produce sponsored interview podcasts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, at this particular time, it is just the wrong time to be producing these types of podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need to devote the time I&#39;d spend producing my interview podcasts to developing my LaSalle Software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve been faithfullly producing The Bob Bloom Show, but without the interviews. Each month, I tell myself, &quot;just one more month&quot;. I&#39;ll start the interviews next month. Next month never comes. What does happen is that the next month rolls around, I&#39;ve done no prep, so I whip up a topic. I&#39;ve been doing something I&#39;ve not done before, and that&#39;s trying to record the podcast in one fell swoop, referring to notes I&#39;ve jotted down whilst recording.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is that I am completely unsatisfied with my uploads. My underlying feeling is a type of resentment that I have to drop everything I&#39;m doing to get The Bob Bloom Show done. A feeling that completely infuses my podcast. I am so unsatisfied with the final recording that I rarely promote my podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will continue to produce my monthly LaSalle Software News podcast.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve not been happy with my LaSalle Software News podcasts.

(107, 3, 3, 'LaSalle Software News #7: Inbound Email, Wrap Up V1.2.0, Dive Into Automated Software Testing, Finally!', 'lasallesoftwarenews7', '<p>Welcome to my seventh LaSalle Software News podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, from Toronto Canada.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Monday, May 02nd, 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I publish LaSalle Software News monthly, at the top of the month, to update you on my LaSalle Software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All seemed to stop in April in the pursuit of my first LaSalle Software paid gig. The web app itself is very modest, very targeted - focusing&nbsp;on inbound email processing. But what a journey it turned out to be. In the end, four new packages cames out of it, of which three are the newest additions to my free open source LaSalle Software:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>standard inbound email handling package (https://github.com/lasallecms/lasallecms-l5-lasallecmsemail-pkg);</li>\r\n	<li>MailGun inbound email parsing package (https://github.com/lasallecms/lasallecms-l5-mailgun-pkg);</li>\r\n	<li>Token based login (https://github.com/lasallecms/lasallecms-l5-tokenbasedlogin-pkg).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Handling inbound email is a whole different thing than sending outbound emails. You send an email to an email API and whoosh! It&#39;s out. What about an inbound email?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That gets routed to an third party email API, which I use http://www.mailgun.com. The email API parses the email fields -- subject, body, headers, signature, file attachments, etc -- and then sends that all along to your web app, as a POST request.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I figured it out, in what became one&nbsp;single bloated package. That I then extracted and refactored into the three new FOSS packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As wonderful as developing these new features for my first paid LaSalle Software web app is, and it is wonderful. And, by the way, this web app is in a full test live deployment. That is, the deployment is completely live, but it&#39;s deployed on a test domain using all my in-house accounts. As wonderful as this is going, I have not progressed otherwise with my LaSalle Software&#39;s version 1.2.0 release.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m in the middle of creating customer records initiated by events, rather than by forms. I need to finish this, which included some refactoring/ .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a whole bunch of little things that I want to do. In no particular order, perhaps take Envoyer out for a spin; try Cloudflare, custom exception views, pushing to multiple repository sites, use the latest Spatie backup package -- and take Akeeba Solo out for a spin, finish my Service Times package, A lot of mish-mash that&#39;s been accumulating on my desk that I want to complete. Not necessarily features, but some dev-ops too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel like things need to settle down. There&#39;s too much mish-mash to go through. I&#39;m in the middle of working on a couple of packages. I want to close out my four software sites and their place do a new web app for my new LaSalleSoftware.ca domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to add to my burdens and get my Granular Permissions package done. Except that I&#39;ve concluded that this package is two packages in one: a &quot;Roles and Permissions&quot; package; and, a &quot;Workflow&quot; package. The workflow aspect is something I&#39;m going to defer. Instead, I&#39;m going to focus strictly on the &quot;Roles and Permissions&quot; stuff. Which I *should* be able to do relatively quickly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to further add to my burdens by building a WordPress-ish &quot;Media Manager&quot; package, although I don&#39;t want this particular package to hold up the entire train. So it&#39;s deferable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a meeting coming up to go over my Events package. What I want to do is lay the groundwork for a really good database model -- what I guess is traditionally known as an Entity Relationship Diagram. And then build the back-end exclusively using my Admin Form Automation. This being for my proof-of-concept volunteer Synagogue site, but I want a nice solid generalized Events package with which to grow scope, since, in part, it has ecommerce tie-in&#39;s. Building the back-end should be a matter of devoting a few hours. I&#39;ve learned that it really pays to figure out the database first before embarking on the back-end stuff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I have version 1.2.0 done, I&#39;m going to carve out time to focus on learning on automated testing. This is a very broad thing, from unit testing to Continuous Integration. But I&#39;m months beyond when I thought I&#39;d deep dive into it, and v1.2.0 is my &quot;make it happen&quot; time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much to learn, and there is always so much coming on stream to learn and incorporate into my day-to-day programming. But I think at this point, the most profound thing to learn is automated testing. I used to think that it was API development, but I&#39;ve concluded that it&#39;s near impossible to do API work without the automated testing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A month from now, I want LaSalle Software v1.2.0 released. I want my two own web apps, SouthLaSalle.com and this SouthLaSalleMedia.com freshly deployed. Hopefully, my second LaSalle Software paid gig will come to fruition shortly, and so should be well on my way with that. My journey into automated testing should be well on its way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A month from now, I want to be in good shape to start my LaSalleMart API. Lingering things that I wanted to wrap up first will be wrapped up, and so I can focus on my ecommerce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My overall goal is to end this year with a really good suite of non-ecommerce software, and to be well on my way with LaSalleMart. This overall goal is looking very good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know when I do these podcasts, I ask myself &quot;should I say this?&quot; and &quot;should I say that?&quot;. Usually what happens is that if I&#39;m asking that question, I usually just leave it out. Better to play it safe. Unfortunately, what ends up happening is that important context is left out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just listened to the latest &quot;Laracast Snippet&quot; (link below). It is inspires me to open up -- a bit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month I&#39;ve been hard on myself for not already having acquired the automated software testing skills that I know I should have. Skills that I planned on working on, by basically stopping everything for a couple of weeks and immersing myself in it. I know that the way I develop software will change profoundly, a change I welcome. But, I need to get over the hump in setting on this new course, which I figure a couple of weeks will solve. The learning will never stop, in fact getting over the hump will be&nbsp;the start of learning automated testing. The signal that I&#39;m&nbsp;well on my way with automated software testing will be the moment when I say to myself, &quot;What took me so long?&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This business of being hard on myself is not productive. I hear podcasts that say that if I do not test, I&#39;m not a real developer. I just listened to all the back episodes of&nbsp;a podcast devoted exclusively to software testing, and throughout have been kicking myself for not diving in. Which has put me in some type of conflict, where I continue programming as I have in order to keep my development moving along but fill my head with internal talk that borderlines interferes with my programming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am pretty sure that if I talk about why I&#39;m not yet doing automated software testing, it will sound like I&#39;m making excuses. See how this goes? So, I avoid the topic, even though it&#39;s a juicy relevant topic. And, of course, I want to talk about it, so it keeps percolating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, now that I&#39;m inspired... I&#39;m going to dive in. I bought Jeffrey Way&#39;s &quot;Testing Laravel&quot; book, I studied his podcasts. I fired up phpunit. And, you know something, every time I dove in, it blew up on me. Frankly, it was frustrating -- really frustrating. Literally, days after I hit the issue of middleware interfering with phpunit, I saw this issue addressed in Laravel. Which confirmed that I was on the right track. But it confirmed something else to me: that this was an intensive topic that had a unique&nbsp;chicken-and-egg problem. Automated software testing is going to change how I program. For the better, of course. So it&#39;s not something I learn and just add to my inventory of Things Learned. It&#39;s going to change how I program features. Unfortunately, learning automated software testing is going to take some time. Plus, it&#39;s a moving target because I use the Laravel Framework, and there were impediments. Impediments which I am sure do not exist now -- in fact, I am sure there are additions now to Laravel that make the kind of testing I need to do much more do-able.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way I see it, automated software testing is a long-term skill. It&#39;s not something that I&#39;m going to learn, and then magically absorb, and then forever after I can do automated software testing. Which, BTW, I am testing my code, but not automating the tests. It&#39;s a classic scenario, I know. Automated software testing is something that I&#39;ll be improving and enlarging my competency over months and months and years and years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need to learn automated software testing, which will change the way I program. I need to change my programming in order to test my code in an automated fashion. So, at what point do I need to learn automated software testing so my programming changes that supports automated testing?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My conclusion is: not really a whole lot. What I really need to do is get over the initial hurdle. Then, from there, make learning automated testing a professional way of life. I have to learn automated testing in real-time, and then in real-time, while I am learning the finer art and science of automated testing, adjust my code in real-time to what I am learning so that my code supports automated testing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that once I am over the initial hurdle that my coding is going to slow down, from its already not-exactly-blistering-fast pace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also no doubt in my mind that I need to stop all my programming in order to get over that initial hurdle. My sense tells me that I need two weeks, maybe three. And, perhaps, what I really need is a week or so of intense struggling to catch on; followed by a week of intense struggling doing real programming in real-time that support automated testing, followed by months of hitting all the real life issues as they come up and dealing with &#39;em all properly as they come up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve read the books. I&#39;ve seen the podcasts. I might as well buy the t-shirt. But the issues that I see I cannot really understand until I am dealing with them. How do I test sending an email? It&#39;s pretty logical in the podcast. But when I am staring at my own code, I am lost.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It really hasn&#39;t helped that my real life programming is a bit more complicated than&nbsp;the introductory books and podcasts. I have dozens of inter-related packages, which is not a scenario typically dealt with in the textbooks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, I should have, perhaps, carved out some time every day or so, to just learn what I needed to learn to get going with automated testing. Just carve out time for the journey, without it impacting my real programming whatsoever. I&#39;ve put the pressure on myself feed back as soon as possible my learning back into my code, so my code supports automated software testing. I think, perhaps, looking back, that I should have separated out the initial learning from real life usage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know that I am spending too much time on my ad-hoc testing. How do I know that I am spending &quot;too much&quot; time on it? What is meant by &quot;too much&quot; time? Well, I have a sense of it, in part because I am repeating ad-hoc tests. I am saying to myself whilst programming more than I care to admit that &quot;I wish I could just run an automated test&quot; instead of re-setting up the ad hoc test. However, I am literally frightened at the prospect of giving a shot at setting up that automated test because I just know -- know! -- that it is really a rabbit hole, and I really would rather get The Job Done rather than get into Yet Another Journey of Discovery (YAJoD-TM).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I quite enjoyed the recent Freakonomics podcasts about becoming good at things&nbsp;(links below). The gist is if you want to be good at something, you have to keep at it. And, you have to be very purposeful too, including very purposefully breaking out of your comfort zone in order to get through the struggling&nbsp;and failing that need to happen to achieve&nbsp;real progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was thinking while listening to these podcasts that I would not even be at this point if I had not made a huge investment in learning, and gone through the Journey of Discovery (JoD-TM) with, Laravel, composer, git and GitHub.com, (PSR-4) namespaces, (PSR-2)&nbsp;coding standards, removing switch statements from my regular programming, removing else statements whenever I can, moving closer to SOLID coding priciples, etc. For me, this all had to happen first. Otherwise, I&#39;d not have the base with which to structure my code in a way that supports automated software testing. So a quick pat on the back!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy a profitable month!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

It&#39;s not quite what I originally envisioned. It&#39;s text heavy, resembling a blog more than a marketing site. On the one hand, I berate myself for not sticking to a traditional software marketing site. On the other hand, my goal is not to promote downloads, nor am I selling software. My goal is for qualified clients to reach out to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A software site that is not selling software, nor signing up people for licence and support subscriptions. That&#39;s my new site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worse, a normal site tries to convert the highest percentage of visitors as possible. Not me, I want people to self-qualify. I set up the site so people click page to page. I want people to understand that doing web apps is a different concept than doing websites. I want people to know my take on what this concept is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People expect traffic from search engine results and from links from other sites. Naturally, not me. Well, not entirely. I expect people to visit my site because I talkeAfter a month of mulling it over, I am pretty sure I need to do version 2.0.d to them. Or, they read an article on my blog. I have a blog site, this podcasting site, GitHub.com repositories, and I&#39;m Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mindset is that someone who is seriously considering contacting me will look at most of these things first. LaSalleSoftware.ca is part of this wider context. Or so I tell myself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know that having conflicting messages, even conveyed subconsciously, destorys conversion. So there&#39;s a very good probability that people who should be contacting me will not contact me. At this stage, I&#39;ll just have to see. Naturally, I&#39;ll want the web apps I do for clients to be aligned: the domain name, the value proposition, the affirmative steps to the call-to-action, the call-to-action, the conversion action, the follow-up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the hardest things was defining my&nbsp;unique sales proposition. Or, in my case, simply expressing precisely what it is that I am doing. At least I&#39;ve been consistent all the way through: to make web app development accessible for my clients. I am putting this line everywhere: &quot;LaSalle Software is my free open source software, built on the Laravel Framework, making custom web application development affordable for my clients&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need to memorize that line -- wait a second, I just wrote it on an index card. How many times have I fumbled for a quick elevator-pitch style shpiel when talking to people who are genuinely interested in hearing about my software? Well, now I have that elevator pitch. Naturally, I don&#39;t like it, it leaves way too much implied. But that it really the point, isn&#39;t it, to convey the &quot;gestalt&quot;, then pause and wait for a question. The last thing you hear is the first thing you remember, right, so &quot;affordable for my clients&quot; is supposed to be the the thing people first ask about. Which means that we talk about the benefits, not the technology. This is the theory in action, right? This is what is supposed to happen, right? I conjured this up all by myself, without focus groups, without role-playing, without rehearsing. All I have is a litany of failed conversations and bad memories. A healthy basis for solid marketing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A standout experience in my Joomla days was at a Toronto Joomla meet-up. I&nbsp;could not explain my LaSalleMart component in an elevator-pitch manner, instead being tongue tied after being asked enthusiastically about it. Everyone in the room was listening, and when I fumbled the answer, someone said that that was so typical of developers who could code but can&#39;t market their stuff. I tried to be a Good Sport, but I was seething, because I was fumbling the translation from technical Bob speak to regular speak, and that processing was very slow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another standout experience was at last year&#39;s True North PHP Conference. People genuinely asked me about my software, and I fumbled, bumbled, and stumbled the explanation. A few people chastised me for not having an elevator-pitch style answer, in the most friendly way. I will say that I released version 1.0 a year ago, and was not confident about my software like I am now. On the other hand, so what?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I am confident about my software. I am ready to onboard wonderful long-term clients. I have my marketing stuff done -- new site, new business cards, updated profiles, networking. And, an elevator pitch!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the organizer of the York Region PHP Group. Although PHP groups are officially called &quot;user groups&quot;, I have already taken out the word &quot;user&quot;. Although PHP users are developers, placing the word &quot;user&quot; in the name attracts non-developers who mis-understand the technical nature of the Group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, again, I have a standout Bad Experience with this &quot;user vs programmer&quot; thing. This was an ongoing issue back in my Joomla Toronto Group. There was a developer side to the group, and a user side to the group. The bias was to be more a user group. Which made total sense. And, which caused me to irritate people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My personal opinion is that open source software is technical&nbsp;manna from heaven. Joomla is free open source software. Just like WordPress. Just like LaSalle Software. The PHP programming language, the Laravel Framework, are FOSS. Available for free. You can basically do what you want with the software for your own use -- the idea with open source is that the changes you make for your own use, you upload what you&#39;ve done -- to the extent that you are not revealing proprietary info, I assume -- to &quot;give back&quot;, so others can benefit. Anyways, the software is absolutely free. And not only is it free, but you can read the code itself. Millions upon millions of dollars of development time went into the software, and you can just download it for free and look at the code directly. Is that amazing or what?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I pointed this out, my enthusiasm was not universally shared. The software was, how shall I put this, somewhat&nbsp;idiosyncratic. It did things because that&#39;s what was coded. Sometimes the best answer was a source code dive. I&#39;m all for projecting the source code onto the screen and doing a walk through. Ah, well, no way most &quot;users&quot; want to see source code. We can talk about the code, we can talk about our interpretations about what we think the code is doing, but doing a walk through of the source code that is freely available for download -- we don&#39;t do that. Because we are users.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that does not sit well with me. You know why? Because the money is in the technical stuff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many times have I heard that &quot;I am just a user, that technical stuff makes my eyes glaze over&quot;? Countless! Can I tell you a secret? I could care less that your eyes are glazing over. The money is in the technicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember the line, &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message\" target=\"_blank\">The Medium Is The Message</a>&quot;? Well, I believe that &quot;The Technology Is The Business&quot;. &nbsp;Oh boy, I can&#39;t say that, that&#39;s just narcissistic hogwash from a self-centered developer. Well, for those people with underperforming WordPress sites, who are tired of hearing how magical SEO and social media are but don&#39;t see the results, maybe a light bulb will go off. A web app is <em>not</em> a website -- these are different concepts. No matter what business you are in, you can make more money with technology. There is no cookie-cutter answer to how. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea right now is to do your own API&#39;s. So that your data is available to third-party software. Or, just to make your data available to your growing customer-facing technologies. Offer a superior customer experience via technology, and your sales will go up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who is creating value? The user? Or the programmer? I hate to be the one to break it to you, but the programmer is creating the supra-RoI. This is what I believe. One of the greatest software value-added creations was created by extremely technical software engineers, originally for other software engineers, and was released as FOSS so other software engineers could use it. This was the Jenkins continous development server, and any intrepid user could snag this incredible server for free. Not easy to use, not easy to learn, not easy on the ol&#39; eye glaze thing. But a massive game changer. Struggling with continuous development early on yield supra-profits. Not without pain. But the possibility of making way more money from custom software development than your competitors was real. That above normal rate of return is diving now, because the CI technology is more and more accessible. It&#39;s becoming a standard thing, so not using CI costs you profit opportunities, but using it does not not necessarily makes you more money than your competitors. Although I don&#39;t think we are quite there yet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Front-end technologies. Who is creating that? Users? Did a user create VueJS? Did a user create the new Yarn? Did a user create the Laravel Blade templating system? I think not! A user would be wise to be up on these tech trends so that they understand where to focus their investible dollars for the best return.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, I took the word &quot;user&quot; out of the York Region PHP Group&#39;s name. I don&#39;t want people complaining that the meet-ups are too technical. A PHP &quot;user&quot; are programmers, so the more technical the better. And the business value of technology is created by techies, not non-techies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know that my clients are not technologists. I don&#39;t want my clients to be technologists, I want my clients to be very good at their business. I want my clients to have a visceral type of understanding that custom software development is itself a profit center and is worthy of effort, focus, and investment. That&#39;s a rare client!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boy, did I veer off topic, onto something else that is on my mind!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the True North Conference, I am starting on LaSalle Software version 2.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first time, so it feels, I am not starting a whole new version because something external made the software out of date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The underlying framework did not undergo a sudden overhaul;&nbsp;nor have the developers stopped working on it;&nbsp;nor have they silently decided to make key promised features private but outwardly keepi up the pretense of future releases; nor have the developers taken forever to release the production version; nor have there been any internecine political intrigue resulting in questionable code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is downright refreshing to be able to tell you that I will be working on a fresh version by choice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is refreshing to tell you that I&#39;ll be using LaSalle Softweare version 1.2 until version 2.0 is out. There is no reason to stop using v1.2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not feel the pressure to produce v2&nbsp;like I did with v1. That in itself is about the most refreshing thing about it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crux of it is: LaSalle Software needs a real API. That is the bottom line.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;API&quot; stands for Application Programming Interface. The full name is so sleep inducing that we might as well pretend that API is an actual word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API means no screens. No forms. All those things that you are used to seeing on a website. Well, there is literally nothing to see here folks!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An API is a separate thing. Separate from an administrative area. Separate from the front-end. Separate from you smartphone and tablet app. It&#39;s a whole separate thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API is data. You want data, you fetch it from the API. You want to add data? You give the data you want to add to the API.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those of you waving your arms up and down at me that an API is more than just data, I know. But let&#39;s just leave it at that for now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software needs an API, and I need to learn how to do API&#39;s. So there&#39;s the impetus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting a-fresh, I can do software testing from fresh. I can set up&nbsp;continuous integration from fresh.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The API, the software testing, the continuous integration -- I will finally do these things. The only way to learn is to do it, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be doing. Full cycle software development -- it&#39;s exciting!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Laravel version 5.3 is not a breaking change. I feel emphatic that I must stress this fact. Laravel 5.3 is a very good version, and I want my LaSalle Software to use it. I started upgrading my packages, which are based on Laravel 5.1 LTS, but decided to stop because the better thing to do is to do a re-write.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to interject here that I am not interested in this taking another two years. If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve been thinking about late at night, it&#39;s that I need this version to come to fruition fast. I&#39;ve come up with a few answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly,&nbsp;I already have version 1.2. As I mentioned, this code is not obsolete. I&#39;m starting fresh, but not at zero. This time, and how sweet it is, I do not have to throw out my existing code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software v1 is organized into installable packages. These packages mimick an API set-up. There are packages called &quot;API&quot;, which are not true API&#39;s but were meant to house the data intensive code. These packages do not have any screens, just like an API. These packages receive internally generated &quot;requests&quot;, and the return &quot;responses&quot; back to the other packages. I&#39;ve taken great pains to standardize these internal &quot;requests&quot; and &quot;responses&quot;, so there&#39;s opportunity to use the code. If not use &#39;em, then at least to extract the best things. Because, of course, I&#39;ll be refactoring. Purely from my existing software organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason why development will not take two years is because I am convinced I will need less code. I am pretty sure that things will not get more complicated, but they will get more simple. How? Refactoring existing code will be a big help. Laravel 5.3 will be a big help. Between you and me, I purchased Laravel Spark and will continue to study its codebase, which Taylor -- Laravel&#39;s author -- created -- this will help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will also need less code because the command bus design pattern that I used -- well, that&#39;s going buh-bye. In v1, you submit a form in the admin, that data is put into a command bus via a data object, and that object is then &quot;thrown&quot; to the API package. Ooooh, this is not how it&#39;s going to work in v2, because that&#39;s not how it works with API&#39;s. I can dispense with the entire notion of a command bus and instead use one line of code to get the data to the API.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess you could say that the LaSalle codebase will undergo a cleansing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing I did was use a custom type of &quot;response&quot; in order to get the data from the API packages back to the admin packages. Well, in v2, I&#39;ll just use genuine request and response objects, and completely forget about using anything custom. So that&#39;s a bunch of code I won&#39;t need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I haven&#39;t told anyone, but I&#39;m going to do something else. I&#39;m going to reach out and ask people for opinions and help. It kind of dawned on me that I am doing an open source project, and that project includes ecommerce, and maybe it would be nice to get a few tips. I have no ambitions about LaSalle Software growing in popularity, so I&#39;m not trying to pre-engineer a growth curve. I wouldn&#39;t mind getting some advice here and there, and being a Laravel based FOSS project, I&#39;m sure some people wouldn&#39;t mind purveying some advice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One area of advice is with the API schema language called Swagger. Ok, it is now known by a different name. Specifiying the API&#39;s in Swagger, and then testing the endpoints. There is a new Laravel package that generates boilerplate Lumen from Swagger files, including boilerplate tests. That is interesting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to speed up v2 development is to not do ancillary packages. The mail packages, the project and to-do packages. Honestly, these can wait. The customer database -- no, gonna build these into v2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am excited that I&#39;ll have an opportunity to refresh the admin with VueJS. VueJS is a javascript framework that is very popular in the Laravel world. The existing display I am using in the admin is a bit frustrating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think once I know how I&#39;m going to do the API&#39;s, because doing API&#39;s is a whole new thing for me, things will settle down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Version 1 represented a monumental need to learn. It was not just Laravel that I needed to learn, but all that was involved with web applications. My coding skills took a turn for the better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Version 2 represents another monumental amount of learning. API&#39;s, Laravel&#39;s Lumen framework, Swagger, testing, continuous integration, Laravel 5.3.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward to it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy a profitable month!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(113, 3, 3, 'LaSalle Software News #13: Deep Studying', 'lasallesoftwarenews13', '<p>Welcome to my thriteenth LaSalle Software News podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, from Toronto Canada.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Thursday, December 01st, 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I publish LaSalle Software News monthly, at the top of the month except for September, to update you on my LaSalle Software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is my free open source Software, built on the Laravel Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software includes&nbsp;a content system, user and login management, a normalized customer database, an administration back-end, customized admin form automation, and more, built with the Laravel Framework version 5.1 LTS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS <em>NOT</em> THE COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, this is really a script, not a transcript, because I write it out in advance and then read it. I strayed off the script a bit this episode.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wow, November was a busy month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am happy to say that I did move these podcasts over to SoundCloud. The URLs are really nice, no having to hit some threshhold number of listeners before being able to use a sane URL. Mine is <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lasallesoftwarenews\" target=\"_blank\">SoundCloud.com/LaSalleSoftwareNews</a>. If I&#39;m lucky, iTunes will have updated my RSS feed to SoundCloud by the time I publish this. It was a lot less involved to get my dozen podcasts to SoundCloud, but still an effort. Podcasts look nice on SoundCloud, and I have the player displaying on my Media site. I should not have to worry about iTunes and SSL certificates again. A</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a help page on SoundCloud about submitting my podcast to TuneIn. It looked easy enough.. Page looks really nice:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/LaSalle-Software-News-p938325/\" target=\"_blank\">http://tunein.com/radio/LaSalle-Software-News-p938325/</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You start a local PHP group, you arrange for a meet-up, you come up with a decent topic. And then realize at some point that the one doing the presentation is, well, me. So, I did the first presentation, on Design Patterns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My write up at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yorkregionphp.ca/2016nov14_meetup.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://yorkregionphp.ca/2016nov14_meetup.php</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speakerdeck:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/bbloom/design-patterns-consultant-hype-or-best-practices\" target=\"_blank\">https://speakerdeck.com/bbloom/design-patterns-consultant-hype-or-best-practices</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the True North PHP Conference earlier in the month, I knew I&#39;d be doing the meet-up&#39;s presentation, so I was taking notes about speaking. That helped, but I did not like my own talk at all, which figures. One thing I don&#39;t want to do next time is worry about the slides during my talk. I&#39;ll volunteer someone to do the clicking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing is that I have no passion for the topic I was presenting, which for some reason was most&nbsp;evident to me afterwards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing is that, at the True North PHP Conference, I got a lot out of the live coding sessions, which were too few and far between. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be doing more talks, as the fallback person when a presenter can&#39;t be found for our small growing group.&nbsp;When I do present, I will do less slides and more code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My impression from the podcasts I listen to is that live coding is the most harrowing presentation to give. Because doing something live, there&#39;s going to be mess ups. At True North, the Events Sourcing live coding demo messed up. Beau talks about it at the start of his <a href=\"https://thatpodcast.io/episodes/episode-34-say-what\" target=\"_blank\">That Podcast</a>. So, things will go wrong. The upside is that that I get so much out of demos that have show code, have live code demos, and log into sites to show what something really looks like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the thing that set me down this conclusion was my terrible description of the Forge service. One of our generous Group sponsors is <a href=\"https://forge.laravel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Forge</a>. I couldn&#39;t believe how bad my description was, as I stammered on the things I remembered about it while standing in front of people. Furthermore, I realized that attendees need to see a deploy in action. Forget the verbiage, let&#39;s log in!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of this writing, it looks like we&#39;re going to have trouble getting a speaker to talk about&nbsp;the WordPress REST API plugin at our December 13th meet-up. If this is the case, then I&#39;m going to put together a live coding demonstration. I&#39;ve never used the REST API plugin, but if I&#39;m going to research it, then forget the slides and show the code and log into everything!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My write-up of the recent True North PHP Conference is on my <a href=\"https://southlasalle.com/truenorthphpconference2016\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was their fifth and final annual Conference. It was my second. Learned a ton, including a tidbit about Amazon Web Services&#39; lamda function thanks to Vic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason my LaSalle Software version 2.0 work is delayed is that I accepted a short term part-time gig. At the True North&#39;s Friday evening Microsoft&#39;s Azure Hackathon, I was asked if I could help out with a year-end crush of projects. If you wonder if organizing a PHP Group can lead to gigs, this is&nbsp;your answer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had other client work to do. I did move my podcasts to SoundCloud. I got a bunch of things done. Basically, I cleared the path so I could start focusing on my new Software version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve never been so excited about building software. This is going to be great! How can it be that I&#39;ve never done an API, I&#39;ve never done Continuous Integration, and I have a third-of-an-inch stack of index cards of things I have to learn, but it&#39;s going to be great?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&#39;s the point! These are things I have to be into, and I&#39;m getting into them. I&#39;ve read up on all the things I have to learn, and am ready to do it for real. I am still convinced that this will be the shortest from-scratch &quot;greenfield&quot; development I&#39;ve ever done. There&#39;s always those things that take days to figure out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to use SwaggerHub.com to build my API&#39;s swagger specs. Swagger is a way to describe the API without actually building the API. It&#39;s a way to design the API first. Swaggerhub is an software-as-a-service site where I can edit my spec. One reason I am using it is because it seems so straight forward. However, there is more to it and I am spending some time with videos and playing around. And so it goes as I build this new skill of building API&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam Wathan released the first of his software testing series. I&#39;m going to make this series a priority because it is a rather thorough treatment of software testing via building a real life Laravel app. As well, Matt Stauffer&#39;s Laravel Up and Running book is coming out, and I want to do a real deep dive into this book. Plus, I have new equipment coming to set-up. A great wrap-up to a great year, with a solid start to a fantastic 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: After recording this episode, I discovered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sensio.cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Sensio Cloud</a>, looked at <a href=\"https://blackfire.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Blackfire</a>, took yet another peek at <a href=\"https://www.mulesoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MuleSoft</a>, discovered <a href=\"http://www.jitterbit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JitterBit</a>&nbsp;(very much like their pricing page), scratched an itch to visit <a href=\"http://www.ca.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Associates</a>, and visited <a href=\"https://www.runscope.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RunScope</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy a profitable month!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(118, 3, 3, 'LaSalle Software News #18:  A Conference of Perspective', 'lasallesoftwarenews18', '<p>Welcome to my eighteenth LaSalle Software News podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto Canada. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Thursday, February 01st, 2018. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I publish LaSalle Software News monthly, at the top of the month except for September, to update you on my LaSalle Software. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Apologies for the two skips in the MP3. About a third of the way in, and near the end.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yesterday I attended the CanTech Conference at the Toronto Convention Centre, thanks to a friend who graciously sent me a complimentary ticket. Crypto currency was the Big Topic, but I managed to listen to an artificial intelligence talk, noting that one of the companies was based right here in Richmond Hill. The late afternoon talk with five Canadian bio-tech company CEO’s was very interesting as they each talked about their recent travails. You go to these things and you expect puffery — how great this company is and how great that company is. It was much more compelling listening to how their ship was listing to one side and how they then righted their ship. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I’m early for the talk. Early enough to hear a good chunk of the previous round of presentations. And what type of companies are presenting? As one of the presenting CEO’s said, “this is not a block chain presentation”. One company is a cable TV technology company and an internet provider who talked a bit about providing co-located servers. I was thinking to myself that if I talked about co-located servers at my meet-ups I just might be laughed all the way out the door (or thrown onto the hockey rink at the Magna Centre where we’ve been holding the York Region meet-ups). In the world I live in, it’s all about the cloud. Thankfully that presentation talked more about their cloud infrastructure than about co-located servers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CEO of the cable TV tech company did an interesting presentation. Well, in the context of the Conference, probably one of the most pedestrian topics. But interesting to me! He said that cable companies worldwide have to deliver their content to mobile devices. Doing so requires a different delivery technology than what many cable companies have, so his company provides them with the technology to deliver content via the internet to devices. This company licensed their software to the cable company, sending in a team to install their software onsite at the cable company. This CEO used the most exquisite language to convey the reality of getting his technology into the cable companys’ platform: essentially a no-go. Ironically, he used the term “DNA” in a way that may or may not have resonated with the bio-tech CEO’s presented after him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what was this CEO’s solution? Why, they spun up their own software as a service!  Did he talk about the technical guts of his SaaS? No. Honestly, this was not the forum for a technical deep dive. Of course, I’m doing the deep dive anyways. There’s only one way he architected his SasS product, because his team’s been doing what I’ve been doing, right? His tech’s have been reading how Netflix has 600 individual services driving their business and content delivery. 600 individually constructed and deployed and monitored programs. Each of these separate programs serve their own little function. Each is a “cog in the big wheel”. Netflix does not run a single massive program that streams out stuff. It has 600 individual programs that work together to stream out stuff. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, what is that architecture called that Netflix uses, that this CEO likely uses for his new SaaS? Yes, micro services architecture. And what is the architecture I am struggling with right now? Yes, that’s right! Same one. Micro services. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, getting away from my screens, getting away from my usual habitat, letting myself not worry about this or that technical challenge, it felt really good. It was seriously relaxing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This presentation comes along, and my brain starts going over stuff I’ve been researching. Gee, his team had to struggle with an authentication server. Maybe they expanded it to an “Identity Management Server” to allow for deep granularity. What roles did they set-up? Was it a matrix or a hierarchy of roles? They very likely used OAuth2 and Json Web Tokens, but given their specific use case they probably developed proprietary implementations. Hey, remember, OAuth2 is a framework, not a specific technology or implementation! Did they put their services behind a VPN? Did they use an API Gateway? Did they build API Specs? Where are they putting these individual services. Amazon Web Services? Azure? Something else?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So they went down the rabbit hole. Just like I’m doing. And what am I coming to grips with? I’m now getting down to brass tacks about constructing a free open source, Laravel Framework based Authentication Service, Gateway Service, Blog Content Service, Podcast Service, Event Service, and an initial web application front-end. I basically have one major issue to figure out. Then work out some minor issues, and then time for real code — whew! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought: boy, I’ve been in the weeds so intensely that I almost forget what I’m trying to achieve. It’s a pretty ambitious thing I’m trying to do. But sitting there yesterday I also realized that I am actually pretty close — a lot closer than I realized — to getting LaSalle Software version two off the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truth be told, I had a lousy month with something I’m involved with as a volunteer. One day, I hope, I can share it with you. No, it is not related to the meet-up groups I am involved with. This thing took a gargantuan amount of time, was incredibly distracting, and got in the way with my software development. Reading RFC’s is not something you might not chose to do normally, but all this background stuff did not help. The good news is that things got better near month-end. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I hate to admit it, but I’m a bit rusty with the Laravel Framework. As I’m about to dive into coding for my own Software, I started all over with Adam Wathan’s TDD course and I partake of Laracast daily. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this presentation lit my mind up. I know that I need to do something about my LaSalle Software website to make it much more clear what my software is all about. It was great listening to business plans, target markets, rates of return — it got my mind on the right track about my own software. I took copious notes while I was inspired. I actually made these changes to my site already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software v1 is a fully functional free open source web app based on the Laravel Framework v5.1. It comes with an administration login with automatically rendering database forms so you do not have to create input forms for each database table. There’s a fully functional blog. It is designed as a monolithic web app, but the individual functions are organized as composer installable packages. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This software lowered the cost of getting clients into real web application software, sped up proof-of-concepts, and focused client investment into value added features and custom front end designs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software v2 is intended as a free open source micro services architected software. The purpose is to offer the basic common features needed to get a basic services environment up-and-running in order to lower the initial costs to clients. Another intention is to solve the issues related to creating and maintaining a micro services environment instead of revisiting them each Install. It will use the Laravel Framework v5.6, OAuth2 guidelines and Json Web Tokens.\r\n\r\nThe initial set-up will have a front-end web application with an administrative login area, an internal API Gateway, an internal Authentication Service, and a Blog Service. Later will be an Event Service (for scheduling meet-ups!). All the while, I have my eye on creating commerce services. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Service is an independently deployed API. A micro service is a small API performing a specific function. My assumption is that each LaSalle Software service will deploy in the public internet, and not within a VPN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s so much terminology and technology overhead. Yes, many times it seems overblown and overdone. A payoff is being able to set up multiple front-end apps that use the same back end. A payoff is being able to cope with huge traffic growth. A payoff is being able to focus teams on individual services instead of having to manage one huge monolith. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s great to take a step back to get out of the weeds and get a better perspective on the journey that’s been LaSalle Software version 2.0.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(119, 3, 3, 'LaSalle Software News #19: Signed and Sealed Client Server', 'lasallesoftwarenews19', '<p>Welcome to my nineteenth LaSalle Software News podcast.</p>\n\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto Canada. </p>\n\n<p>Today is Thursday, March 01st, 2018. </p>\n\n<p>I publish LaSalle Software News monthly, at the top of the month except for September, to update you on my LaSalle Software. </p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>A longstanding client has a number of WordPress clients, and in February there were more issues than usual to look into. </p>\n\n<p>WordPress is not a “fire and forget” technology. You cannot set up a WordPress site, and then just leave it alone except for the odd new blog post.</p>\n\n<p>As a public service announcement, I remind you that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is important to update your theme, plugins, and WordPress itself. Sometimes this updating is straightforward, sometimes it is not. </li>\n<li>It is important to back up your WordPress site. </li>\n<li>It is important to remove unused themes and plugins. </li>\n<li>It is important to not archive unused websites in the webroot.</li> \n<li>It is important to store backups off the webroot.</li>\n<li>It is important to keep your commercial licenses up-to-date. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, I decided to get into web applications instead, using the fabulous Laravel Framework. I am very happy that I did, and very happy that I am working on my second LaSalle Software version, despite the length of time it is taking. </p>\n\n<p>API security is something I’ve been studying, if not something that I’ve been understanding. Last month was an excellent month of learning, ending with a pretty good idea of how I will implement API security in my LaSalle Software.</p>\n\n<p>As LaSalle Software will implement a micro services architecture, API security is a huge deal. Instead of building one big web app, I will have small separate apps — in the form of API’s — executing distinct functions. These API’s will be completely separate from each other, deployed separately, maintained separately. </p>\n\n<p>My last major question about API security is the question of how to ensure that the API talking to another API is the actual genuine API, and not a spoof. Or that the API is genuine, but the data was intercepted in transit.</p>\n\n<p>Laravel has a package for setting up an OAuth2 server called Passport. Underneath Passport is the League’s OAuth2 server package. I’ve gone through the source code of both a few times. Then I saw that there there is a demonstration for download of Passport, created by Laravel Daily. This demo contains two complete Laravel apps. One is the OAuth2 server, and the other is a complete app that calls the OAuth2 server — aka “The Client”. I set up both the server and the client on a fresh Digital Ocean droplet, each with its own domain that I own but are not in use, set up on Forge. Basically, I set up the client and the server as real Laravel web apps, so I can see the demo in action. And, of course, I can mess with the code and see the database as it changes. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you to Laravel Daily! This demo is a big help in seeing the flows in action. The client is powered by VusJS, which makes sense, except that I need to see the interaction with the server in standard Laravel. So I figured out how the client calls the server in a Laravel controller — specifically, the post-login call to fetch the data from the server to list in the client. I have more messing around and figuring out to do, but I’m now way ahead in understanding this aspect of API security. </p>\n\n<p>Something else I did was print out the Json Web Token handbook from JWT.io. Well, the first six chapters, because the rest of the handbook delves into the encryption algorithms. It helped to study the print version.</p>\n\n<p>At a recent Laravel Toronto meet-up, SoapBox, a rock solid Laravel Toronto sponsor for many years, presented an in-house API security solution they developed. A solution which included an open source package. I studied the presentation and library, with the idea of asking questions about them at this week’s Laravel Toronto meet-up. What a help it was to just get up in front of the group and voice my questions. I don’t know what it is about just vocalizing it but that in itself helped. Then I asked some questions, and the answer I was looking for came back as a question. The question was: “do you control both ends?”. Do I control both the client app and the API? The answer is yes. Controlling both ends means I can seed each side with a secret key, and then use that secret key to encrypt and un-encrypt the JWT. </p>\n\n<p>I know that I will be using the League’s OAuth2 server package, and that I will be using one of the JWT (I know it’s pronounced “JOT”) packages out there. However, I do not want to use Passport as-is, nor do I want to use the SoapBox package as-is. I want a streamlined custom solution to use for LaSalle Software, so that’s what I am going to do.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, there are new third party packages for the Laravel Framework for Cross Origin Resource Sharing, and for Content Security Policies. These packages look very good, and should be good for augmenting security. They do not replace using encrypted JWTs.</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>I submitted this podcast to iTunes, again, and have not heard back so I emailed a support ticket today. My RSS feed is through SoundClound. My podcast is also available on Tunein (see links in the header above).</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>Hosting the York Region meet-ups at the Magna Centre has worked out well. I’ve been to meet-ups at Starbucks, which incidentally I do not like, at pubs which has its pros and cons, at libraries at community centres, and on company premises. But never at a hockey rink. The Magna Centre has five hockey rinks, a gym, a huge swimming pool, a Second Cup kiosk, the Newmarket Athletic Wall of Fame, and a few rooms to rent out. The rooms are used for childrens’ programs, hockey league meetings, and that sort of thing. Open source technology meet-ups are quite different, and the staff there is starting to know us — I am convinced due to our novelty. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to host meet-ups in the northern end of York Region, because new people were tending to come from above the Thornhill/Markham/Richmond Hill area. In our first year we spent most of our meet-ups in the south end (and forays into the eastern edge), and I was convinced that in our second year we had to get northward. It has worked out very well. It is noteworthy that many times it’s whispered in my ear to have one or two meet-ups “back south”. </p>\n\n<p>Having the meet-ups in one place has provided a nice logistical constancy. There’s no guessing where the meet-ups will be. No worrying about where to find the entrance, or that the entrance is locked. The parking is plentiful with obvious entrances — one entrance has a big sign and a stop-light. There are multiple washrooms in the facility. There is no worrying about attendees wandering into peoples’ work areas or kitchen areas. Logistically, the Magna Centre is, by far, the friendliest venue.</p>\n\n<p>The room we rent has a terrific view of the main ice rink. A group of power skaters practices during out meet-ups. My speakers have noticed that I will watch them put up the blue padding against the end boards in case someone misses a turn, watch the different age groups take their ovals around the rink, with the older kids skating closer to the boards and the younger ones skating within the centre of the rink. There are usually a couple of hockey games going on the other rinks. I was worried that we would be distracted or that whoever was in the rink would stop and stare at us. There’s been no staring, and there’s been minimal distraction. Children have come in looking for their parents (hey, look, there’s a bunch of adults over there!), and parents have come in looking for their children. It’s amusing when a couple of kids come into the room loudly with their equipment clanking, look at us and stop cold, and then slink on out of the room. I’m waiting for one of these kids to ask us if we use PHP 7’s type hinting.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to close out this meet-up season at the Magna Centre. I am thinking of mixing things up a bit next season, in part because the new subway is finally open — that construction is done (I think). </p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

There\'s too much terminology. Too much for what LaSalle Software  Version Two needs.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, you use a specification for security to cover all the security bases. Its tried, it\'s true. The vulnerabilities have been plugged up. You don\'t use your own thing because you are then starting from scratch. Why would you do that?</p>\n\n<p>Well OAuth2 is not a technology, is not an implementation. OAuth2 is a specifications of how to do certain things.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do, what I’ve been feeling like is the way to go, even though it feels sinful, is to just take the pieces that I need — and ignore what I do not need.</p>\n\n<p>So, instead of using packages that implement OAuth2 — I am very grateful that these packages exist that implement OAuth2 and JWT — just take the pieces that I need from these packages into my own package.</p>\n\n<p>These packages are mysterious to me. I cannot follow everything. I cannot reverse engineer them completely. It\'s a real rabbit hole.</p>\n\n<p>These packages have a lot of dependencies. They cover a lot of use cases, and there\'s much genericizing. So, I cannot follow specific flows.</p>\n\n<p>There have been many times when i thought maybe i just do not understand what\'s going on. However, I have enough of an ego — sounds sinful doesn\'t it! — to know that I can understand this.</p>\n\n<p>So I will be taking the best of what i need from these packages and putting them in my own packages, even though it feels sinful to not be using these packages which are tried and true for a lot of people.</p>\n\n<p>I need to need to move on. At some point, enough research, enough reverse engineering, enough frustration.</p>\n\n<p>I need an OAuth2 implementation that simplifies down to my specific needs.</p>\n\n<p>I need software that is emphatically easy to follow, that is stripped of the stuff I do not need, and that has minimal dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>So as sinful as it feels to stray from tried-and-true packages, it feels even more sinful to use packages that I do not feel comfortable using.</p>\n\n<p>Have a profit of my profitable month!</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

The food was really good although I was not that hungry. It was well attended. They went around the room and everyone introduced themselves with their “Elevator Pitch”. I concluded at the time that it would be a good idea to join the RHBOT at some point because here was a ready-made way to network with potential local clients. I’ve been getting their emails ever since</p>\n\n<p> I keep putting off joining, mainly because my Software is not ready.  But I concluded that “now is the time” to join. It’s not like I’m going to tag the initial release of my Software, and then the next day find clients at a RHBOT event. Networking takes time. And funny enough, it would be great to connect with local businesses who can sponsor York Region PHP meet-ups. But I think that, instinctually, I need to get out more. I need to hang out with devs. And, I need to connect with the local business community. Joining the RHBOT is a natural, ready-made way to connect.</p>\n\n<p>There was a time when I actively avoided pursuing local clients. So joining the RHBOT with the intention of on-boarding local clients is a complete change for me. Basically, a complete180.</p>\n\n<p>When I talked to the nice people at the RHBOT when I filled out the forms, I realized pretty fast that whenever I talk about clients, my hostility towards clients is very clear. Yes, I harbour hostility, and channelling that in the general direction of potential clients not productive. So, I decided then and there that my upcoming podcast will be about clients. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been touching on the topic of clients in my podcasts here-and-there, but never really getting into it. For this podcast, my intention is to clearly hit it head-on. So, I knew that I would want to write out my podcast completely in advance, which would take me a couple of weeks since I would edit my podcast endlessly. Meaning that my software development would be taking yet another pause. If I actually formatted my transcription properly, and  perhaps word things in the right way, I could refer potential clients to it so that they would understand my stance.</p>\n\n<p>Getting my podcast out at or near the first of the month is a hugely important to me. I’ve tried different things to keep to this deadline, and have succeeded this year. However, this podcast is different and a delayed publication is warranted.</p> \n\n\n<h2>I Develop Custom Web Applications</h2>\n\n<p>What is a web application? Web apps are viewable in browsers, that do just about anything that you need done. Actually, you can program web applications to do things that never display in a browser, such as overnight notification runs.</p>\n\n<p>Websites? People understand websites. Web applications? People do not understand web applications. I have decided that in describing what I do, that I will prefix “web app” with the word “custom”. People understand “custom”. They assume what I do is expensive! I am finding that people understand “software”. So if I substitute “software” for “web applications”, saying “custom software”, then there’s more understanding. The phrase “Custom Web Software” seems like an inherently understandable idea.</p>\n\n<p>I am a web applications developer, specializing in the superb <a href=\"https://laravel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel Framework</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am working on free open source software (FOSS) with which to base client engagements. This software will have the basic web app features my clients — and myself — need. It will be based on the Laravel Framework. I call my software “LaSalle Software”</p>\n\n<p>LaSalle Software Version One <a href=\"https://github.com/lasallecms\" target=\"_blank\">exists</a> and works. I wrote all the basic — and some not so basic — functions for a ready made blogging application. Features included automatic database form creation, SEO features, two factor authentication, and an administrative back-end, among other features . It is a monolithic architecture, written as a suite of installable packages, and was a great starting platform for further custom web application development.</p>\n\n<p>The first version of LaSalle Software needs work. It needs to be updated to the current version of the Laravel Framework. The code needs to be cleaned up. There are new features to include. So I set out to do all this stuff, release it as Version Two, and then go seek clients. Well, something happened during this update.</p>\n\n<p>The entire concept of Version Two changed. I decided to drop the approach of putting all the features into one single web application. Instead, I would separate things into — wait for it — their own separate web applications. In general, I stopped using the “Monolithic Architecture”, and adopt the “Micro Services Architecture”.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main reasons why I want to use micro services: because I can; and, because the payoff is bigger.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of the technical infrastructure to support micro services architecture has come down drastically. So much so that small business owner-managers can adopt micro services architecture as the springboard to grow their web based software as a profitable line of business.</p>\n\n<p>The payoff is bigger because we can do more things that make more money with micro services than with monolithic. I know this is debated, rather fiercely, but IMO micro services architecture is very much here to stay because it yields fundamental business benefits that monolithic web app architecture cannot match.</p>\n\n<p>Not having done micro services before, it’s been a huge rabbit hole of learning. I basically have to start Version Two from scratch. So Version Two is on a new road, and as a result is taking much longer than anticipated.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Family of Long Term Clients</h2>   \n\n<p>I am about to talk about clients in a way I have not expressed before. I know that for some people, this is going to come across as, well,  perhaps as offensive. Or merely as a big turn off. Or perhaps I’ll be perceived as having “an attitude” or “just another consultant who thinks highly of himself”.</p>\n\n<p>Well, whatever will be, will be. It’s been quite a journey, with many clients, with many IT contract jobs, and many situations under my belt.</p>\n\n<p>I decided that the only way to really talk about clients is to talk from my heart. To convey what I am really thinking. </p>\n\n<p>I am now seeking a nice little family of long term clients. Maybe half a dozen to a dozen, representing a varied aggregate portfolio of web apps, which generate a varied aggregate portfolio of revenue.</p>\n\n<p>I am not looking to build an agency with a ton of clients and a ton of teams.</p>\n\n<p>I am not looking to start renting office space.</p>\n\n<p>I am not looking to hire full time staff.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking to support my web app projects with small teams of talented freelancers. Likely people I know, or people referred by people I know, from the local technology groups that I help organize.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this is critical: I want to invoice each client every month. More precisely, I want to invoice each web application each month.</p>\n\n<p>This is the elemental, fundamental, feature of the web applications in my consulting portfolio: these web apps either make money every month; or, produce significant savings that free up money. Money with which to pay me! Essentially, the web apps in my consulting portfolio generate the money that pays my monthly invoices.</p>\n\n<p>This is the absolute core idea of my consulting: that the custom web applications in my consulting portfolio pay my monthly invoices.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, it is rare that a website or web app makes money, or manifests sufficient value, each month. Rare!</p>\n\n<p>So, if your custom web application is generating money, then you are doing something that is not common.</p>\n\n<p>The difficulty in building money-making — or money-saving — custom web applications and websites is one reason why many consultants are in the business of doing builds only. Clients typically have cash for the build. The only invoice-able money is that initial cash. Since the thing that is being built will very likely not generate revenue, the consultant has no expectation that there are further invoice-able opportunities beyond the build.</p>\n\n<p>These consultants are in the business of finding new short-term clients. They don’t build e-businesses, they close deals. The client is buying a finite, fully pre-defined product.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, the client is not concerned with the technical infrastructure and tools. The client is typically concerned with the delivered end product.</p>\n\n<p>There is certainly money in doing only builds. And some builds do spawn post-delivery invoice-able opportunities. But the real business is client acquisition, and the game is keeping as much of the finite build money as possible. The client is going away, it’s a one-and-done deal. It’s build-and-run. It’s churn-and-burn. Yesterday’s deal is ancient history. Today’s deal is yesterday. It’s all about getting tomorrow’s deal.</p>\n\n<p>What I want is completely different. I want uninterrupted monthly invoicing. The invoice-able amounts are not finite. My focus is building my clients’ e-assets. My client list is finite.</p>\n\n<p>My clients and I are engaged in custom software development. Requirements are rarely fully pre-defined before coding begins. Which is a profoundly different activity than delivering a fully formed product. My clients are not buying software. My clients are creating software!</p> \n\n\n\n<h2>Need An Exquisite Understanding of Value You Offer and Value People Are Looking For</h2>\n\n<p>Building a revenue generating web app requires an exquisite understanding of value. What is the Value Proposition? What value do people seek?</p>\n\n<p>It is enormously difficult understanding value.</p>\n\n<p>Once you understand value, then two equally enormous tasks await: what is it exactly that you want people to do; and, how do you get people to do what you want them to do on your site.</p>\n\n<p>Your Value Proposition, your Call(s) To Action, and your Conversion action.</p>\n\n<p>When you look at your custom web application this way, the end result will be a front-end that will be completely different than what you thought it was going to be. In fact, it may end up being completely counter-intuitive.</p>\n\n<p>I look at things things backwards: \n<br />What do you want people to do on your website (Conversion) ? \n<br />How are you going to get them to do what you want (Calls to Action) ? \n<br />What is the value that you are offering (Value Proposition) ? \n\n<p>Then, I frame just about everything in terms of abandonment — which I know can be incredibly irritating. Abandonment is just that: people leaving your site — and probably never returning. Unfortunately, abandonment is the single biggest action people take, so this abandonment is my usual default starting point.</p>\n\n\n<h2>We Are Doing Custom Software Development — You Are *NOT* Buying Ready-Made Software</h2>\n\n<p>It is important to understand that we are doing custom software development. </p>\n\n<p>This means that you are not buying software!</p>\n\n<p>I am not installing pre-fabricated, ready-made, software for you. We are building software that does not yet exist together! </p>\n\n<p>You know what I learned about developing custom software? It is intimate! </p>\n\n<p>It means that we have to work as a team.\n<br />It means that we have to collaborate. \n<br />It means that we have to use some type of software development project methodology. \n\n\n<h2>We Produce The Project Culture: Pathologies and Politics Sublimate Into The App, Producing Abandonment</h2>\n\n<p>Boy, is that a mouthful.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, the dominant culture within a tech project becomes the dominant theme embedded in the thing that is produced. So much so that I find the joke, a camel is a horse designed by a committee, not funny anymore.</p>\n\n<p>People are people. Office politics is office politics. And before you know it, what is ultimately produced is an abandonment machine.</p>\n\n<p>It is enormously difficult to attain an exquisite understanding of value when “people are people” and when “office politics is office politics”, the probability of achieving “an exquisite understanding of value” drops exponentially. </p>\n\n<p>In my experience, client pathologies sublimate into what we are creating, destroying conversions. Since conversions — getting people to do what we need them to do — is the transactional moment a web app generates money, it is important to leave client pathologies at the door.</p>\n\n<p>I know you are the client, I know that you are paying my invoices. But I also know that we have to put our talents and perspectives together — to collaborate — to create a conversion machine, not an abandonment machine. I cannot begin to count the number of clients I’ve had who do all sorts of things to demonstrate that they are the powerful clients and because they are paying me I need to just do what they tell me.</p>\n\n<p>People are people and people want to be in control. But we’re building custom web-based software that is supposed to make money every month, month after month after month.</p>\n\n\n<h2>I Advocate Iterative Development of a Disposable App</h2>\n\n<p>I am a huge proponent of the Disposable App during requirements gathering. It is incredibly cheap, and the payoff is huge. </p>\n\n<p>You know the concept of what you want, but unsure about what exactly to create? How do get from concept to web application?</p>\n\n<p>My answer: create a little web application. Play around. Whip up a quick database. Punch in some fake data. Create a few forms. Keep it basic, get a feel for things. We’re eventually going to delete this web app, so no need to get fancy. </p>\n\n<p>How much does it cost to whip up a disposable web application? While the barista is making our coffees, I can whip up a new Laravel based app on my MacBook Pro. Although we really should get this web app on a cloud server, which I can do for myself on my own accounts in 15 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Then it’s like figuring out a recipe. Do this do that. No, that’s not what I want. Back up, try something else. There’s no risk because you are not going to break anything in your systems. You can feel things out. Call people over to take a look. Change a bit of this and a bit of that. </p>\n\n<p>Iterative development. Make a change, get feedback. Rinse and repeat. No need to know everything first. Just discover what is needed as we go along. Build a little prototype. Get feedback. Update your prototype. </p>\n\n<p>In my experience, iterative development with a disposable web app produces the best answers. Better than a “requirements document” and endless emails back-and-forth and lengthy threads in Basecamp. And do you know why this is so? Because the focus is on an actual product, and that product is an actual web app. </p>\n\n<p>You can feel a real, even if ultimately disposable, web application. You can touch it. You can see the underlying code. You can see real forms. You can send out real emails. You can try out real overnight processes and see the results the next morning. It’s tangible. </p>\n\n<p>Disposable apps with iterative development — excellent combination!</p>\n\n\n<h2>Case Study One: Bricks and Mortar With Web App</h2>\n\n<p>Combining bricks-and-mortar with web applications — in this case, it was a website — is very powerful. In this case study, based on a real client, the store was akin to a specialty food shop in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The store was located on a main tourist-y street, the owner held store events parallel to street and town events, participated in street and town events, and also had an commence store. </p>\n\n<p>So there were three main themes: events, brick-and-mortar store, and commerce. </p>\n\n<p>The three themes translated into these value propositions, which flowed into these calls-to-action: um… errrr…. well… the value propositions and calls-to-action were not well defined. Not anywhere near anything like being “exquisitely understood”. Although, over time, the owner absorbed an incremental awareness.</p>\n\n<p>So the website did something that  is very common: it laid out a buffet for visitors. The home page visitor had to wade through a whole lot of everything in order to find out how they wanted to proceed through the site. The peripheral areas of the home page — the header, footer and, unfortunately, columns, had densely packed general information about the store, along with a few links into internal web pages. The body of the home page included upcoming events, and scrollable calendar for events, pictures of the store, products, and testimonials. The footer included a newsletter sign-up form and a link to the local tourism bureau. I am sure I forgot something — oh yes, recipes! The footer included a couple of recipes using products sold at the store. </p>\n\n<p>The layout was “responsive”, meaning that the entire page collapsed into one long scrollable thing. Especially on a phone, there was a whole lot of scrolling going on for the visitor to find what they are looking for — if they have the patience. </p>\n\n<p>There was a time, back in the day, when you could put anything and everything on your home page. People would take the initiative to click through websites. Those days are very much over. </p>\n\n<p>No one wants to sign up for newsletters, so the newsletter form is never submitted. </p>\n\n<p>No one bothers looking at recipes. </p>\n\n<p>Ecommerce sales are rare. </p>\n\n<p>There is no call to action with the events, but people are asked informally where they learned of the event and due to the “top of fold” placement upcoming events, some people do attend from the website. </p>\n\n<p>Ecommerce sales are mostly from tourists who agree to be receive emails so they can buy items on sale from their home town. </p>\n\n<p>The owner had the ambition of the website commerce being a huge sales machine. The idea was that the brick-and-mortar presence would give people the confidence to buy online to site visitors from the Continental U.S. </p>\n\n<p>The reality was the opposite: the website drives brick-and-mortar store traffic. Those who consummate in-store purchases and agree to receiving emails became, essentially, “members” of the e-store. </p>\n\n<p>Tourists research destination stores before leaving their hotels. So the home page should convince people to make the store a destination.  </p>\n\n<p>The e-store should be off the home page completely, and should be a membership only store with e-marketing geared to on-boarding members, seasonal specials, and favourite item replenishment delivered to one’s home.\n\n\n<h2>Case Study Two: Compelling Feature Product</h2>\n\n<p>An e-store with a compelling feature product, sold as a hobby, where the product is ancillary to a bricks-and-mortar store. The e-store had a lot of products, tools, parts, and supplies, but basically sold one product only and one set of supplies. \n\n<p>This e-store had a lot of potential. A micro services architecture would have really come in handy because multiple front-ends using completely different domains coupled with a single back-end would have been terrific. \n\n<p>What was entirely unique is that a lot of people who came to this site were ready to buy, and they would be interested in learning about new models of the featured product. \n\n<p>The site spent almost all its real estate on convincing people to buy. It was not easy for people to figure out how to actually buy. \n\n<p>The home page was hopelessly cluttered, filled with products no one bought and with information no one cared about. \n\n<p>People wanted to see the featured product, they wanted to know the shipping rate and delivery areas, sometimes they wanted supplies, and they wanted to know what connection the owner of the site had with the product. \n\n<p>Incredibly, people researched the product elsewhere. The decision to buy was a separate research exercise that resulted in links to my client’s website.\n\n<p>But the website was never streamlined to cater to buyers. Nor what it streamlined to sell essentially the one product people were looking for. The cart needed substantial work to lower abandonment. \n\n\n\n<h2>You Are Going To Need A Bunch of Accounts</h2>\n\n<p>Your going to need a number of accounts associated with your web applications.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to domain registration, clients must own their own registrar accounts, and ensure that their names and addresses are associated with their domains. There is no other way to unequivocally demonstrate domain ownership. My general advice is to never, ever, delegate domain registration. </p>\n\n<p>You need many different accounts to do web applications. </p>\n\n<p>You need a software repository account.\n<br />You need the Laravel Forge account for web app set-up on the cloud server.\n<br />You need a cloud account. If this is not Amazon, then you will also need an Amazon Web Services account. \n<br />You potentially need a Continuous Deployment account. \n<br />You potentially need an app monitoring account. \n\n<p>Clients often want to avoid the hassle of maintaining their own accounts. It’s a convenience thing. Why be bothered when your consultant can “take care of it”. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is account ownership. Who really owns your accounts — me or you? </p>\n\n<p>Probably a worse problem is control: do you control your accounts or do I control your accounts?</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, it is better for both of us that you clearly own and clearly control your own accounts. </p>\n\n<p>You will never be locked out of your accounts. </p>\n\n<p>You will always see what is going on with your accounts. </p>\n\n<p>You will be billed directly for your accounts so you know exactly what you are paying for your account. </p>\n\n<p>If you do not like what I am doing, you can change my passwords. </p>\n\n<p>You will need a software repository account. This is a must. If you are ok to have your software viewable (and downloadable) by the entire world, then these accounts are free. Otherwise, private “repos” accounts will cost. You will have an account at GitHub.com or GitLab.com. Although BitBucket.org is a popular choice (free private code repositories, free up to 5 users), I found that it is best when using the Atlassian tools (e.g., JIRA). The pricing has changed for GitHub and GitLab, see:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub pricing</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/#gitlab-com\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab pricing</a></p>\n\n<p>You will need a cloud server account. I use <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Ocean</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You will need a <a href=\"https://forge.laravel.com/auth/register\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel Forge</a> account to set up cloud servers for Laravel Framework based web apps.</p>\n\n<p>You will need an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Web Services</a> account. </p>\n\n<p>You may need other accounts. </p>\n\n\n<h2>SEO versus Conversion</h2>\n\n<p>Strictly speaking, I do not “do” SEO.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not the person who is going to get your site listed number one on Google.</p>\n\n<p>However, I do believe search engines love original content, and that at a minimum you need to add original information-rich content onto your site at least once or twice a month.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that you need to put content on your own site, and not on another site.</p>\n\n<p>I also believe that it is a lot easier engaging in SEO activities than in focusing on conversion. What do all those people who find you do when they get to your site? What are they supposed to do when they get to your site? What is important to you?</p>\n\n<p>Remember: I think backwards! So the first thing I think about is not SEO, but conversion — the action that we want people to take! And when I think of conversion, I think of it in its opposite: abandonment. Because, the way I see it, if it is not conversion, then it’s abandonment!</p>\n\n<p>I am intensely interested in conversion. Very intensely interested in conversion.</p>\n\n<p>I also believe that SEO becomes more effective when you do it backwards.</p>\n\n\n<h2>To Laravel Framework Or Not To Laravel Framework</h2>\n\n<p>A shout-out to one of our wonderful York Region PHP regulars who sent me the link to this Quora discussion <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-still-use-pure-PHP-if-there-are-so-many-incredible-PHP-frameworks-like-Laravel\" target=\"_blank\">Why do some people still use pure PHP if there are so many incredible PHP frameworks like Laravel?</a>”.</p>\n\n<p>This is a turn of phrase along the classic line that it is not a good thing to be married to a framework. This question is sure to come up as I talk to people about web applications, so let’s talk about it now. Great timing to receive this link when I did — thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Even better timing is the latest interview at \"Voices of the Elephpant\", who just <a href=\"https://voicesoftheelephpant.com/2018/05/04/interview-with-nils-adermann-and-jordi-boggiano/\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed the Composer authors</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Things have changed. So the premise of the question is out-dated. It is not a binary decision whether to use PHP frameworks. As they pointed out in the interview, the PHP frameworks are not “monolithic” anymore. </p>\n\n<p>More than ever, we can use the best tools for the job. The reason is due to <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Composer</a>. So the frameworks are breaking themselves up into pieces, and making these individual pieces Composer installable. </p>\n\n<p>For me, I specialize in Laravel so I want to use it. That’s my bias. I always have the option of not using it, or using only those pieces that are relevant, if that’s what the job warrants. </p>\n\n<p>We have an abundance of choice now, more than ever. It’s very exciting!</p>\n\n\n<h2>A Word About WordPress</h2>\n\n<p>It seems to me that if a potential client has a website already, then that website is probably done with WordPress.</p>\n\n<p>What is WordPress? It is the world’s most popular blogging software.</p>\n\n<p>WordPress comes with a lot of standard features, including a full adminstrative back-end. It is easy to install, it installs on shared hosts and cloud servers, it is updated regularly with security enhancements and feature improvements. For the features that do not come with WordPress, there is a breathtaking universe of third party layouts and features that are installable into WordPress. So it’s not a big deal to get an ecommerce website going with Wordpress.</p>\n\n<p>WordPress is free. A lot of the third party stuff is free. Yes, free. Anyone can download WordPress. There is an entire eco-system of nominally priced themes and plugins.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I know WordPress. Yes, I support WordPress sites. In fact, I’ve been using WordPress for at least a decade. It just so happens that it is not my tool of choice. I much prefer to be in actual web application development.</p>\n\n<p>I think if you want to know my opinion about WordPress, we need to go out and have a beer. With phones turned off.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not have a lot of money to build a website, and you really want a website, then you can buy your hosting for a couple of dollars per month, you can buy your domain for $10, and then you can install WordPress onto your host for free. Perhaps buy and configure a prepared theme (caveat: not always as straight forward as it looks), install some plugins, and voila! You have a website.</p>\n\n<p>If I were to focus on site builds only, then I would probably focus on WordPress. WordPress is not only free, but it is open source, meaning that I can see the actual behind-the-scenes software. Even better, I can mess with the source code anyway I want, for free! Yes, really! Ask me when we have that drink, and I will take you on a tour. So if I focused on site builds, I would mess with WordPress to make it even easier to install, configure and customize. Why? Because my number cost when doing a build with WordPress is labour. The less labour, the more of that build invoice I keep for myself. </p>\n\n<p>I really do not want to be in the WordPress business. Nor do I want to be in the “build” business.</p>\n\n<p> I am not 100% sure what I will do when the time comes to work with WordPress, to be honest. I think I’ll just take it on a case-by-case basis. There are articles about using an established WordPress website with the Laravel Framework, so I may be digging into these articles one day.</p>\n\n<p>I am definitely not going to be your deep discount low cost web guy. The nature of the custom web applications I do precludes that.</p>\n\n<p>Not only that, but things have changed. At one time, back in the day, quality web hosting that could reliably run WordPress cost a fortune. It was manna from heaven that WordPress, and a bunch of other similar projects, were offering a free open source blogging platform to install on this expensive hosting. The cost of buying blogging software was nuts. So WordPress and other new projects allowed people to have websites. But that was then, and today is today. The economics of the cloud has changed, to the point where it is within reach for an small business owner-manager to run a micro services architecture portfolio of web applications. For all intents and purposes, the marginal cost of installing WordPress these days is effectively zero — really, just the cost of my time.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I have struggled to create free open source software to provide the basis for deploying micro services architectured web applications, I am where I need to be, and where my small business owner-managers need to be. Why? This is where the overall business value resides. The fact that there are no established off-the-shelf free open source software such as what I creating is validation enough that I am doing precisely what I should be doing. Not that there is not any software out there. But things are still evolving. The technology and infrastructure is still evolving. </p>\n\n<p>WordPress to do a website? Ok! WordPress as a technology platform to grow your digital lines of businesses? No. </p>\n\n\n<h2>Local PHP Groups Update</h2>\n\n<p>The end of the 2017-’18 meet-up season is upon us. </p>\n\n<p>I am the organizer of <a href=\"https://yorkregionphp.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">York Region PHP</a> and <a href=\"https://yorkregionlaravel.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">York Region Laravel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am the co-organizer of <a href=\"https://laravelto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel Toronto</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And I am now the co-organizer of <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/GTA-PHP-User-Group-Toronto/\" target=\"_blank\">GTA-PHP</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Being active in these meet-up groups gets me out talking to other local PHP devs. It’s great! Great to talk tech, and great to network. </p>\n\n<p>I am putting the York Region Laravel group on hiatus. I am keeping the Twitter account, the meetup dot com group, and the domain, so I can kick-start it back up when the time comes. It’s too much bootstrapping a second York Region meet-up group. The Laravel Framework certainly gets enough attention in the York Region PHP group anyways! </p>\n\n<p>York Region PHP has enjoyed a terrific season. </p>\n\n<p>Just our second season, our core group is growing. Holding all the meet-ups at the Magna Centre turned out to be very beneficial. After the first season, the stability of having meet-ups in one venue has been soothing. The venue itself has been a success. Although it is not a “corporate” environment, and the audio-visual support is limited, I think we’ve come to take some things for granted. Such as: plenty of washrooms and ease of getting to them; tons of free parking; easy to get to; doors are always open and there’s staff at the front; there is a Second Cup kiosk; there is always a lot of people which makes it feel nicer than entering an empty building after hours.</p>\n\n<p>The room rental is not free. I arranged and sponsored all the room rentals this season. Which, I sense, contributed to a feeling that we all pitched in this year to follow-through on a successful first season. </p>\n\n<p>It was liberating to not hold meet-ups at corporate venues, to be honest. We all showed up which was not easy given that everyone has a busy schedule. But the growing core group wants this group and it shows! </p>\n\n<p>Our growing core group delivered the presentations, which was fitting for this season. </p>\n\n<p>We held the meet-ups northward, which turned out to be the right thing to do. There is a growing population of PHP devs above Elgin Mills Road who will not venture to meet-ups in south York Region, and absolutely refuse to head downtown to the Toronto meet-ups. We now have a core group from central York Region, as well as have people visiting from the north-west and north-east areas of York Region. </p>\n\n<p>Another outstanding feature of the York Region PHP group this season is the construction! The new subway opened. VIVA construction is, shall I say, pervasive, on Yonge Street at Hillcrest Mall and west on Highway 7. The Davis Drive Rapidway opened. Construction on Bayview northward from Elgin Mills is incredible. The Gormley GO Station opened recently. </p>\n\n<p>I have concluded that York Region PHP, and the PHP devs in York Region in general, want to see downtown styled presentations right here in York Region. So I will have this in mind when I start planning the 2018-’19 season in a few weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Being a co-organizer of the GTA-PHP and Laravel Toronto meet-up groups should help in making this happen! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>My Recent Micro Services Architecture Presentation</h2>\n\n<p>I presented “Micro services in a Laravel Environment” at last week’s York Region PHP meet-up. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/bbloom9/micro-services-and-lasalle-software\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It is really about my journey with the micro services architecture for version two of my LaSalle Software. A journey filled with angst! And angst is what came across in my presentation. </p>\n\n<p>The ongoing discussion was a help. And the post meet-up advice I received was a big help. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>I sense that there was enough info about micro services, OAuth2, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to serve at least as an introduction. </p>\n\n<p>I have pretty well decided that I’m going to implement a very scaled down version of OAuth2, because I control both the front and back ends, because I want to use software that I understand completely, because I want very understandable software, and because there is a lot of OAuth2 authentication flows that I just do not need. </p>\n\n<p>I have also pretty well decided that I’m going with a scaled down version of JWT. I agree with the notion that the JWT header be excluded when you control both the front and back ends so the encryption method is not defined with the token. As well, I am wondering if I really need a signature, because the signature encrypts the payload.

(122, 3, 3, 'LaSalle Software News #22: Exquisitely Unconventional Clients', 'lasallesoftwarenews22', '<p>Welcome to my twenty-second LaSalle Software News podcast.</p>\n\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto Canada. </p>\n\n<p>Today is Friday, June 01st, 2018. </p>\n\n<p>I publish LaSalle Software News monthly, at the top of the month except for September, to update you on my LaSalle Software. </p>\n\n\n<p>---</p>\n<p>I was not sure that I\'d have enough content to merit publishing a June podcast at my usual \"top of the month\". However, from the notes I took during the recent \"New Member Showcase\" event at the RIchmond Hill Board of Trade, on top of some discussions I had at this month\'s GTA-PHP meet-up, my doubts were quenched. </p>\n\nAt the \"New Member Showcawse\" event, I had a table with which to put up a trade show display. I was granted a full minute to address everyone at once with my elevator pitch. On my table was my MacBook Pro opened to my website\'s newly revised home page, and my copy of \"Laravel Up And Running\". \n\nThe event was well attended and I talked to a good number of people. \n\nPeople wanted to know what my software does, how much I am selling it for, if it is designed for a specific industry. \n\nI lost track of how many times I was asked: \"What is a web application?\".\n\nWell, what is a website? Since the people asking typically have a WordPress site, let\'s ask the question, what is WordPress? Let\'s look at websites through the WordPress prism, since this is where a lot of potential clients are coming from. I have links galore in the following paragraphs in my transcript. \n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> is the world\'s most popular blogging software. It is free open source software licenced under the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/license.txt\" target=\"_blank\">General Public LIcense version 2 or later</a>.\n\nYou can see the actual source code here at <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Github.com</a>.\n\nWordPress is written in the <a href=\"http://php.net/\" target=\"_blank\">PHP language</a>, a highly popular language for building websites and web applications. \n\nA good recent podcast about WordPress by the PHP Roundtable team is <a href=\"https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/all-things-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. A few things about this podcast: interesting comments about the new \"Gutenberg\" feature, good quick look at WordPress\' history, and I disagree with the comments that those who are not part of the solution are part of the problem because WordPress has real issues that are not solve-able by you or me. \n\nWordPress is an all-in-one thing. The front-end and administrative back-end exist within the same domain. The database is typically installed on the same server as the source code. \n\nThe entire codebase exists under the \"public_html\" folder, meaning that if server level restrictions were lifted you would be able to see every single source file that runs WordPress in your browser. \n\nThe front-end is what the public sees -- basically what is generally referred to as The Website. \n\nThe administrative back-end is the login area where you enter new blog posts, create new users, etc. \n\nThe blog posts and user information, among others, is stored in the database. \n\nWordPress is free, every webhost is configured to run it, the hosting is cheap, and it has a huge eco-system.\n\n15 years ago, a very young fella was unhappy with blogging software. So he grabbed a free open source blogging software and tinkered with the code. He tinkered with it so much that he gave it a new name: WordPress. \n\nWordPress grew to the extent that it has lines of businesses and has received venture capital financing. WordPress may be free to download, but it is controlled by the people who run and back it, and its purpose is to create a profit. The latest PHP Roundtable podcast talks about this issue. \n\nUsually one domain is associated with one WordPress installation. A WordPress installation is an all-in-one unit of front-end, back-end, and database.\n\nOk. We\'re getting there... A small business owner-manager typically has just one website -- a WordPress installation where the front-end, back-end, and database exists as one unit, associated with a single domain (\"domain-name dot com\"). Since there is one website, everything that would be in a website is in that one single website. \n\nIn my opinion, shoving everything into One Big Website is a huge mistake. \n\nIn my opinion, the answer is *not* having multiple WordPress sites, although you might think that that is where I am heading. I am definitely not heading towards having multiple independent WordPress installations. Oh boy, I\'m getting a headache just thinking about that!\n\nIn my opinion, the answer is having multiple front-ends, and a single back-end. \n\nEach front-end is designed for a narrow specific purpose. You can have as many front-ends as you need. Each front-end can be written in their own language, designed for differing operating systems and devices. \n\nThere is only one back-end, but that back-end is comprised of many separate but related applications and API\'s.  \n\nConventional wisdom says that doing things this way is beyond the reach of small business owner-managers: the money involved is insane, the technicals are beyond the pale, and the time commitment prevents the \"real business\" getting done.\n\nWell, the economics of the cloud, and the evolution of the technologies involved, have put this way of doing things within reach of small business owner-managers. \n\nThe problem is that it may be within reach, but it is not easy. It is definitely, and will remain for your peers, The Road Less Travelled.\n\nConventional wisdom says that only start-ups and large businesses can have technologies that are themselves lines of business -- that themselves generate revenue. Small businesses just use technologies as adjuncts and helpers for their \"real\" business. Technology is not itself a \"real\" business.\n\nThings are changing. Things are not idyllic for the small business owner-manager. But things have, and are, changing, so that small business owner-managers have within reach to make technology itself a profit centre. Or, at least, to intimately intertwine their \"real\" business with technology to make even more money. \n\nIn my opinion, it comes down to the elemental activity is custom web application development. \n\nIn my opinion, small business owner-managers have to get into the custom web application development business. As a core line of business. \n\nIn my opinion, those who struggle now will be the most rewarded, especially over the longer term. Why? Because it is not easy! And it is not going to get any easier for a while because the technologies and techniques are still evolving. We\'re still fairly early on with these technologies.  It\'s going to be a while before things settle down. So if you are waiting for some idyllic moment to jump into custom web application development, you\'ll be waiting and waiting and waiting. \n\nThere is no need to upend everything all at once. There is no need to invest gargantuan amounts of money. There is no need to starve your \"real business\" of the love and attention that it needs. To start, there must be the will, the right mindset, and the first modest little project. \n\nThat first modest little project is probably fixing the failure of getting the leads you feel are slipping through your fingers because your SEO is succeeding, but still you are not actually hearing from anyone -- or you are compensating by spending much too much time on social media. \n\n\n<p>---</p>\n\nIn my last podcast, I said that conversions -- people taking the action that you want them to take on your site -- requires an exquisite understanding of value.\n\nWhat value to you offer? What value do people seek from you? It is really hard to define. \n\n\nDid you see the movie Moneyball? A wonderful movie about a major league baseball general manager using analytics to improve his team. What attracts me about the movie is its focus on value. Most people are probably attracted to the movie because Brad Pitt is in it. \n\nThe movie has wonderful scenes about the value of base-on-balls. The traditional perception is that the only way to get on base is to get singles and doubles and triples and home runs. A player\'s ability to get on to first base via base-on-balls is not valued at all. However, the \"moneyball\" view of things, the ability to get on first base is what is valued, regardless of hitting or getting a base-on-ball. \n\nAs a result of this perception of value, a player that can get on base via base-on-balls is perhaps as valuable as a player that can get on base via hits. A player that can get on base both ways is particularly valuable. However, baseball generally under values these players, which means that they demand a relatively low salary. \n\nOk, you are an owner manager of a small business. The thing is, you are not alone, there are other businesses of varied shapes and sizes for customers to choose from. What is \"value\"? What attracts customers to your business -- what \"value\" do customers assign to your business? \n\nValue is a very difficult thing to figure out!\n\nHere is a great scene early in the movie, where the essence of \"moneyball\" is expressed in an underground garage because it is so against the conventional mantra:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpBcwGOvO80\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpBcwGOvO80</a>\n\n\"They think in terms of buying players. Your goal should not be to buy players. Your goal should be to buy wins. In order to buy wins, you need to buy runs.\"\n\nAnd, to buy runs, you need to get on base. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnvvn0xrV24\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnvvn0xrV24</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FmXa1l--K4&t=25s\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FmXa1l--K4&t=25s</a>\n\nWhile still in the underground garage, \"I see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from\". \n\n\n\n<p>---</p>\n\nI do not do spec work. That is, doing work for someone without being paid for it -- in the hope of being compensated later.\n\nSubmit a Request for Proposal? Not me.\n\nCheck out your development website and submit written comments about it for free? Not going to happen.\n\nSubmit detailed (or even general) proposals? No.\n\nSubmit proof-of-concept web apps as proposals? Don\'t even think about it.\n\nInsist on discounts because you are a not-for-profit? Wasting your time. \n\nSpeculative work, joint ventures, non disclosure agreements. Forget it. \n\nI am prepared to talk about sponsored open source software, and in fact want my clients to do this. However, I\'ve been burned by what I will call \"Intentional Unintended Misunderstanding\", where the perp feigned understanding of what was really meant by the term \"free open source software\" and what features were really intended for this free open source software. The perp just wanted a discount on their software development and exploited the only way he saw that he could get it. \n\nIt took me just two events into my RHBOT membership to get hit up for spec work. \n\n\n<p>---</p>\nI\'ll have more to report on my Software next month.\n\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

I appreciate the glimpse into a consultant&rsquo;s real-life work-a-day with Joomla. Thank you Steven!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think it does not matter who hosts your Joomla site, think again. This post is a fabulous follow-up to the running series of Steven&rsquo;s tweet rants (twants?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me? I&rsquo;ve been using Hostgator since 2006. Yup, shared hosting. The &ldquo;Business&rdquo; package is what I recommend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While I&rsquo;m on the subject, sort of, I recommend that you separate your web hosting and domain registration. If your webhost goes down, then you can set up your site on another host because you&rsquo;ll still have access to your DNS. If you do both with the same host, and you cannot access your account&rsquo;s cPanel, then your site is g-o-n-e. Cost of registering your domain elsewhere: $7 (on GoDaddy &mdash; with promo code!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steven&rsquo;s post is at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://joomla-and-more.com/2011/09/23/hosting-from-hell-joomla-hosting-in-action/\" target=\"_ blank\">http://joomla-and-more.com/2011/09/23/hosting-from-hell-joomla-hosting-in-action/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S.

I&rsquo;m talking about something different, something deeper, something that gives you power, gives you control.

There is no definitive, cut-and-dried, answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reasons people are into Joomla are quite varied. There are an infinite number of paths that bring people to Joomla. Yet, a common theme is: people are now coming from somewhere else. &ldquo;I was using this, but I need X, which inspired my search, which led to downloading Joomla&rdquo;.

Also, if you have not restored a site from Akeeba before, can you please do a restore or two or three just to get the hang of it; and, just to ensure that your backups do actually backup.

Consultants who build websites, who do the designing, manage the sub-contractors, integrate different Joomla extensions, migrate data, create articles, set-up the products, and do the training.\r\n\r\nMy Club facilitates my Members sharing their knowledge and experiences. I\'m dedicated to running the Discussion site where this sharing takes place.\r\n\r\nWhat makes my participation so valuable is how I help grow your knowledge base. Since the valuable knowledge happens when problems are encountered, I will research and pursue these problems, capturing it on my Discussion site in real-time so all Members can see the progression. Basicially, you see my consulting. Very valuable!\r\n\r\nAdd to this: Members participating in the discussions with their tidbits. Very valuable.\r\n\r\nI reply personally to all posts in my Discussion site. There has to be someone running the site, and that someone is me. There has to be someone you can complain to when you haven\'t heard back, and that someone is me. I\'m not going to be accountable to thousands of people who pay nothing to register to a forum site. However, I will accountable to you within my paid Membership site.\r\n\r\nThe Joomla clubs that I\'ve joined over the years are passive. I post a problem and cross my fingers. Within my own Club, I will get to know my Members and the sites they have. And you will too! So, if you post a problem, I\'ll know who runs a site similar to yours and can ask them to look at your post. Even with my nascent Membership, I\'ve already done this. It is a tremendous advantage to be able to double check something on a similar live site.\r\n\r\nNot only are you powerful together, but you are powerful with someone like me actively connecting you to specific Members who can help you out. And Members will be open to helping, because every Member knows the tables will be reversed and they will need everyone else in my Club in their hour of need.\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; background-color: #c1ffc1; border: 1px black solid; padding: 5px; font-weight: none;\">In my Club, you are not alone.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 115%; font-weight: none; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 7px;\">\r\n<h2>Real Life Case Study: Tienda Version Upgrade</h2>\r\n<img style=\"border: thin solid #000000; float: left; margin: 0px 30px 10px 5px;\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/magnifying_glass1.jpg\" alt=\"Case Study\" width=\"244\" height=\"207\" />\r\nTienda v0.8.2 was just released (Nov 01/2011). Here\'s an excerpt of the <a href=\"http://dioscouri.com/blog/141-tienda/2444-tienda-ecommerce-for-joomla-v082-update-available\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>:\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 25px; background-color: #c1ffc1; border: 1px black solid; padding: 5px; font-weight: none;\">Due to a number of functional problems in the last version, we encourage all who are using 0.8.0 - 0.8.1 to upgrade to this version (esp. if you are using the OPC).\r\n\r\nAs with any major upgrade to a large extension like Tienda, we suggest that you always back-up your site... and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>install on a test server first</strong></span>...</blockquote>\r\nDon\'t take my word for it. Take the official Dioscouri word for it: Test upgrades first! I applaud Chris for pointing this out. It is customary to warn about backing up; but, saying to \"install on a test server first\" is not a usual caveat.\r\n\r\nWe are being told up-front that blindly upgrading Tienda to the latest release could mess up our live, money-making, production sites.\r\n\r\nThis is where belonging to my Club can pay off hugely for you: we test new releases together. Different Members test different things. It\'s not just a matter of ensuring that the new Tienda version works for you. It\'s also a matter of ensuring that there are no surprises lurking to bite you in the you-know-where.\r\n\r\nTesting is a huge reason maximum membership is 300, and not 100 or 150 members. We need more sites, not less, to test. We need more experiences with different extensions, templates, and webhosts -- not less! 300 is my guess at the outer limit of how many people I can accept into my Club and still maintain the connection and one-on-oneness that I want to achieve. I need to err on the side of a few more members, not less, to tackle testing.\r\n\r\nBTW, I am happy letting Dioscouri know about bugs we find and solutions we come up with. What is important is that in my Club have the in-house ability to verify the existence of bugs; and, to test our in-house solutions amongst a decent sample size of Members. Doing more in-house lessens Dioscouri\'s burden. Along the same lines, I\'m happy to accomodate Dioscouri\'s request to test specific things -- you, my Members, have to be game for this, of course, because it is you who have the live sites!\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 115%; font-weight: none; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 7px; background-color: #c1ffc1;\">\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;\">We have learned that people who benefit most from Anahitapolis.com services are:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><em><strong>Hackerpreneurs</strong></em> (Hacker + Entrepreneurs) who have experience and knowledge in both technology and business development.

Members who share your goal to grow their online revenue using Tienda.\r\n\r\nYou get a unique Discussion group where knowledge is shared.\r\n\r\nYou save yourself a lot of time and frustration because knowledge tidbits that you need to \"get you over the hump\" are available to you. And, if not, you ask for help! I reply personally to all posts.\r\n\r\nSince we are a connected, intimate Membership we know each other -- well, that\'s the hope! I will get to know all my Members. So, when you have a problem, I can ask Members with similar sites as yours to help verify/test. It\'s not just about your access to me; it is also your ability to connect with your peers in your time of need.\r\n\r\nSomething else you get is maximum Tienda technology via my Club\'s Tienda \"Distro\". I will expand on this below.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the $23.25CAD/month (designed to net to $20 after PayPal fees &amp; Ontario HST) is to be a barrier. Those who don\'t ante up the vig don\'t get in. Those on the inside know that everyone else is paying a vig, and that matters. A big aspect of a Club is that there is an inside and an outside.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the $23.25CAD/month is so I can run my Club, look into problems, maintain my Distro, create tax localization components, create/maintain my \"Distro Control Centre\" component, create new template over-rides, spend time in my Discussion site, write tutorials (I have a couple already on my Discussion site); and, generally work my tail off for my Members.\r\n\r\nMy modest monthly fee allows me to provide you with as much Tienda consulting as I can cram into a month. Instead of doing one-on-one client engagements whose work product you never see, I am unleashed to consult for all my Members\' benefit.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 115%; font-weight: none; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 7px;\">\r\n<h2>Why am I Foresaking Traditional Consulting?</h2>\r\n<img style=\"border: thin solid #000000; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 5px;\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/sucess_next_exit1.jpg\" alt=\"Success next exit\" width=\"181\" height=\"144\" />\r\nWhat did I end up doing for end-user and consultant clients with Virtuemart? I spent most of my billable time fixing, stabilizing, and customizing Virtuemart. I stopped building Joomla-Virtuemart sites from end-to-end, and became the Virtuemart technology guy.\r\n\r\nTienda is a growing market, but smaller than Virtuemart.

This is your right.\r\n\r\nCheck out the blue box at the <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Software Foundation</a>. Tienda is distributed under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\" target=\"_blank\">GPL licence</a>.

Tienda is GPL. You have rights! These rights make you powerful. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The trick is to harness the power that is yours for the taking</span>.\r\n\r\nMy Club is the means with which you harness this power.\r\n\r\nHow? We can take \"sharing knowledge and experiences\" one step further: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I put our shared knowledge and experiences into Tienda</span>.\r\n\r\nEarly this fall, a recent RocketTheme template conflicted with Tienda\'s default category layout. I created a new layout that played nicely with RT. My question to you is: how do I get my handiwork to you, in case you need it?\r\n\r\nSure, just offer this one single file as a separate download. We may end up with a lot of layouts, and at some point you\'re going to get irritated with the download routine. How to make it easy for you?\r\n\r\nAnother scenario: we fix a nasty bug. We submitted the bug report with our fix to Dioscouri. In the meantime, until the next Tienda is released, your Tienda site is without this fix. You manage six Tienda sites that are affected by this bug. In aggregate, we may have 100 Members with 350 sites under their wing affected by this bug. How do we get our fix into your sites?\r\n\r\nI get all of our Tienda Goodness to you by downloading Tienda from Dioscouri, adding our custom stuff, and then giving my custom Tienda version to you. In a word, I maintain a private Tienda \"Distro\" (aka \"Distribution\") that you install and upgrade for your sites, instead of using the Tienda direct from Dioscouri.\r\n\r\nEach time there is a new Tienda version, I create a new Club Distro. Actually, there\'s an intermediate step: testing the new Tienda first; then, creating the Distro. Then you upgrade with my Club\'s Distro.\r\n\r\nWe will have a lot of upgrades. To ease the upgrade process, I installed <a href=\"https://www.akeebabackup.com/software/akeeba-release-system.html\" target=\"_blank\">AkeebaBackup\'s \"Live Update\"</a>. So you go to your site, and upgrade directly from your Joomla Administrator.\r\n\r\nUsing our own Distro with Live Update is extremely powerful.\r\n\r\nI will keep my eye out for all patches, fixes, and whatever else is floating out there, and get them to you via my Club\'s Distro.\r\n\r\nWhen we do our own fixes and improvements, you get those immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen something bad is discovered, we can do something about it, send out a MailChimp blast, and have our solution on your site asap.\r\n\r\nFrankly speaking, there\'s an alternative to using Live Update, called \"Continuous Integration\", where changes are pushed to your sites instead of you pulling \'em in via LU. CI is something to keep in mind -- for later!\r\n\r\nMy doing, and your using, a Club Distro is completely kosher. It\'s your right. It\'s my right. You can re-distribute my Club\'s Distro to your clients -- it\'s your right!\r\n\r\nMy Club\'s Distro is 100% Tienda. You can revert to the \"direct\" Tienda and your site will work -- albeit without my Club\'s Tienda Goodness (which may cause problems) -- because it\'s Tienda. I do not delete anything, nror reconstitute Tienda into different code to make it proprietary. My Club\'s Distro is always 100% Tienda, plus our own goodies on top.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 115%; font-weight: none; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 7px;\">\r\n<h2>Club Software: Tienda \"Distro\" and Components</h2>\r\n<img style=\"border: thin solid #000000; float: left; margin: 0px 30px 10px 5px;\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/distribution1.jpg\" alt=\"Distros!\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" />\r\nIn conjunction with my Distro is my \"Distro Control Centre\" component, which has fulfills three functions: administrator for my Club\'s Tienda Distro; one stop reporting on all Club Software; and, home to tools &amp; utilities that are too small to be stand-alone components.\r\n\r\nAs much as possible, let\'s leave Tienda\'s core PHP alone. Especially Tienda\'s admin, which is busy enough without our shoe-horning more settings into it. We can tinker with Tienda\'s core if we need to, but that code will be administered in this Control Centre component.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 of my Canadian GST/HST/PST is done (using Live Update).\r\n\r\nMy California tax component is halfway done (over 1,700 municipal tax rates!) (will have Live Update).\r\n\r\nI created a proof-of-concept of my Control Centre component. Now that I have a better idea of how it integrates with my Club\'s Tienda Distro and my Tax localizations, I am going to rewrite it. You will install the Distro first, then the tax localization (if appropriate), then the Control Centre. The Distro will create new database tables that the other components will populate, so that the Control Centre can report on them.\r\n\r\nBecause it is your right, and because it makes you powerful, my Club Commerce will have its own base Tienda Suite of Software.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, now we\'re getting to it, Bob is selling software!\". Oh no, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">no I am not</span>. What I am really selling is consulting and running my Club for you. It\'s logical to get as much of your knowledge, your experiences, my consulting, and my running my Club -- the sum total of what we do at Club Commerce -- into code delivered to your sites.\r\n\r\nLocalization is a Big Issue. Having written the Canadian Tax add-on for Virtuemart, I did so for Tienda. I wrote a private California Tax add-on for VM, and am creating one for my Club Members for Tienda based on my VM add-on. I\'m doing more to genericize my Cali Tax component, to make it easier to whip up other tax localizations (I hope!). I want to nail tax and other localization packages to make it easier/faster to bootstrap Tienda installs.\r\n\r\nWe should talk about doing different Distros inside my Club. If I can do a Tienda Distro that has my logo on it, why not \"white label\" it so that your logo is on it -- so your clients see your logo, not mine. Add your RSS feed while we\'re at it. What if my Club maintained a Joomla Distro for you, not just a Tienda Distro, so you could do an all-in-one install.\r\n\r\nMy new \"<a href=\"index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=57:hot-for-custom-joomla-tienda-distros\" target=\"_blank\">Why I am Host for Custom Joomla-Tienda Distros for each Club Member</a>\" post delves further.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 115%; font-weight: none; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 7px;\">\r\n\r\nThe RocketTheme tutorial \"<a href=\"http://www.rockettheme.com/magazine/1292-creating-a-simple-custom-css-joomla-plug-in\" target=\"_blank\">Creating a Simple Custom CSS Joomla Plug-in</a>\" is good.If you want a tutorial, ask; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">since I create tutorials at the behest of my Members</span>;\r\n\r\nWhen you see things like this, ask me to create a generic plugin so you don\'t have to wade through the tutorial. If/when we have a Joomla Distro, we can add this in.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 115%; font-weight: none; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 7px;\">\r\n<h2>Real Life Case Study: Registration &amp; Checkout Flow</h2>\r\n<img style=\"border: thin solid #000000; float: left; margin: 0px 30px 10px 5px;\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/magnifying_glass1.jpg\" alt=\"Case Study\" width=\"244\" height=\"207\" />\r\nA Founding Member wants me to improve the registration &amp; checkout workflow. Especially the address forms that display in the popup box, as his buyers are getting stuck in these forms.\r\n\r\nTienda is well suited to this type of customization because these are classic \"MVC\" views. The solution is to create a template over-ride of these views. The intention is that users will use template over-rides extensively.\r\n\r\nIf I was doing traditional consulting, you\'d never see these over-rides. If you asked me to help you improve the screens, I\'d start with the over-rides I now have in my back pocket, and you\'d pay top rate for \'em. One over-ride in particular, the shipping/billing address form, everyone will want, because the fields are not spaced well.\r\n\r\nFor this customization, I took a good look at the Tienda system plugin. With traditional consulting, I would keep this tidbit in my back pocket. But with my Club, I published a topic in my Discussion site at <a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/anahita/index.php?option=com_discussions&amp;view=topic&amp;alias=tiendas-system-plugin-over-riding-core-joomla-components&amp;id=445\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.southlasalle.com/anahita/index.php?option=com_discussions&amp;view=topic&amp;alias=tiendas-system-plugin-over-riding-core-joomla-components&amp;id=445</a>.\r\n\r\nIt is my you who prompt me into the deeper recesses of Tienda. Real world needs! I\'d not have stayed up poring over the code had it not been for this request. Ultimately, we did not touch the system plugin. What we did do, a wonderful Founding Member and I, was check out Tienda with and without this plugin enabled.\r\n\r\nThis is the real world work that smooths out Tienda\'s rough edges. I want you to be the beneficiary of this work. Maybe you think that the Founding Member I worked with does not want to share this work with you. Wrong! In return for me doing all this workflow work at no extra charge, and in return for receiving the fruits of other Members\' efforts in the future, he\'s happy to share. A four figure invoice was not presented at month-end.\r\n\r\nIs this worth $23.25CAD/month to you?\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 115%; font-weight: none; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 7px;\">\r\n<h2>Groundwork\'s been laid.</h2>\r\n<img style=\"border: thin solid #000000; float: left; margin: 0px 30px 10px 5px;\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/last_spike.jpg\" alt=\"Lots of groundwork done\" width=\"252\" height=\"200\" />\r\nI created this site with NinjaBoard, AEC, and with various extensions for downloads since I could not decide which download extension to use. I now use Akeeba Release System for downloads.\r\n\r\nInstead of Ninjaboard, I am using the Anahita Social Engine, as I want a more \"social flavour\" to my discussions instead of using the regular forum format. Anahita is packaged as a separate distro, so I installed it as-is as a separate website instead of trying to integrate it with this site.\r\n\r\nUpon installing Live Update in my Distro, I created a third site devoted solely to your Live Update requests. So, there are three Club sites: this regular Joomla site for sign-up &amp; downwloads; the Anahita Discussion site; and, a site receiving Live Update requests.\r\n\r\nI applied some \"hackerpreneur\" programming to integrate Anahita with AEC (with LU); and, to integrate the Anahita template with my existing Rockettheme template -- good thing Anahita uses Gantry.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons why I am not using JomSocial. One reason is, conceptually, my Discussion site is not an ersatz Facebook site for Tienda users. JomSocial\'s templating is not my cup of tea. I want to use Anahita in order to learn it, to get a sense of it, to understand if &amp; how it could integrate with Tienda as a basis for helpdesk, CRM, and front-end \"social commerce\" -- topics to explore inside my Club! In 2012, I want to deepen Member profiles via customizations, and expose these profiles to the public -- in conjunction with upcoming Anahita releases.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been adding knowledge tidbits, tutorials, and general topics on my Discussion site. What was initially \"seeding\" my Discussion site with topics has turned into -- well, turned into my Discussion site! Because there\'s participation by some Founding Members, it\'s filling out nicely.\r\n\r\nI am blessed with seven patient Founding Members, who have been paying my monthly vig without complaint. Only one is an end-user site owner, and the love and devotion he is receiving due to his \"only\" status is, well, don\'t get used to it! He\'s been absolutely terrific, and has proven on a small scale the viability of my Club idea. My six consultant Founding Members are real pros, been around the block, and we have various programming skills among \'em. The ability for some members -- not just me! -- to tweak this-and-that in-house is tremendous.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, my 8th Member joined to download my Canadian Tax component. We\'ve looked into other issues, and I\'ve had the pleasure of introducing myself via Skype.\r\n\r\nIt\'s great to grow my Membership slowly to really get to know my Members. But, such a low membership is detrimental. Membership needs to jump to broaden out our Tienda experiences.\r\n\r\nWe run five going-concern Tienda sites among us. Two are catalog sites, and all five are Canadian sites. I good nucleus of people and sites.\r\n\r\nAlong with these sites are the Tienda Distros for v0.7.3 and v0.8.1. I did not recommend v0.8.0 for live sites, so I did not prepare a Distro. When we finish looking at v0.8.2, I\'ll prepare the Distro.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 of my Canadian Tax component for Tienda is done. It has Live Update. Three sites are running this component successfully. It is very gratifying!\r\n\r\nHalfway done is my California Tax component for Tienda. I am genericizing how I do this one so it can be replicated easily (I say easily un-easily!) for other tax localization components.\r\n\r\nMy Distro Command Centre component needs a rewrite, now that I\'ve done the proof-of-concept version and that I am dropping the Nooku Framework (separate blog post about this forthcoming). I actually <a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=39:club-tienda-suite-of-software-screenshots&amp;Itemid=201\" target=\"_blank\">have screenshots of my Club Software in a blog post</a>.\r\n\r\nThis month, besides my Membership Drive, I have to finish my re-done Control Centre component. And update my Distro &amp; Canadian Tax component to accomodate changes in my Control Centre component.\r\n\r\nThen, I have to finish my California Tax component.\r\n\r\nThen, I have a multiple parent category feature to build for a very patient Derek.\r\n\r\nIn between, I have a product attributes tutorial to do. I also need to check out Tienda\'s coupons, as <a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=34:submitted-two-tienda-coupon-bugs&amp;Itemid=201\" target=\"_blank\">I submitted bug report about it</a>. Then I have to include coupons in my Tax components.\r\n\r\nThe groundwork\'s been laid. Sites are done. Distro done. Components are cooking. Discussion site active. To-do list ongoing.

If you ever need to change web hosts, you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue is access to your DNS settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your domain registration and hosting is with the same outfit, then you run the risk of not having access to your DNS settings when your web hosting goes down. Why? Because both domain and hosting administration reside within the same control panel. When you cannot access your website admin (not to be confused with your Joomla admin), you lose access to your DNS admin. No DNS admin, no ability to change your host. So, you cannot backup your site to another host because visitors will never be routed to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not even bother researching if a webhost separates their domain registration from their website administration. I separate domain registration from hosting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve had cases where clients were held hostage by their consultant. They put domain registration, hosting, and consulting in one person&rsquo;s hands. Very Bad! Separate all three. And do domain registration and hosting yourself. Do not delegate &lsquo;em! One thing you want to avoid is your webhost (never mind consultant!) controlling your domain when there is a dispute about your website. Your inability to change DNS gives your webhost enormous leverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve made a few people angry over the years when I refused to register their domain on their behalf.

It used to be general &ldquo;what template club do you like?&rdquo;. Now, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;I want to do this-and-this-and-that-and-that&rdquo; and what extensions and templates will achieve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We barely touched on security &mdash; I want to mention here to delete extensions you are not using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked about Akeeba Backup, and of course I love it. However, it&rsquo;s better to understand how to backup and restore &ldquo;raw&rdquo; first. At least understand configuration.php! I suggested yesterday that one should restore their site to a test site with AB (or whatever!) when their site is humming along. Two reasons: restoring is a skill; and, you should test your backups. If something is wrong with your backup, the time to find out is sooner than later. The time to learn restoring is, ahem, sooner than later!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that, for the December meet-up, those attending with specific questions should should get 15 minutes of clear group time to present their scenario &amp; get quick round-table answers.

So, go download it!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I cringe when people matter-of-factly say they are installing Virtuemart. I assume they mean VM 1.1.x series. You do realize that this code started as &ldquo;PHPShop&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Mambo Shop&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Virtuemart 1.0 for Joomla 1.0&Prime;, then &ldquo;Virtuemart 1.1 for Joomla 1.5&Prime; &mdash; note that it&rsquo;s not VM 1.5 MVC for Joomla 1.5. Maybe you do not care about the code underneath the hood, but you should! Maybe you are seduced by the &ldquo;Editor&rsquo;s Choice&rdquo; logo on the VM&rsquo;s JED listing, but there&rsquo;s no article justifying this decision, especially why they are gracing their &ldquo;seal of approval&rdquo; on a non-MVC extension. As well, I assume that there&rsquo;s an implicit decision to migrate to VM 2.0 when it&rsquo;s released, which is not without its issues. But, Tienda is dismissed out-of-hand!

Although Venkatesh Rao calls it &quot;developeronomics&quot;, he should &quot;Rastin-ize&quot; it into &quot;Hackerprenomics&quot;, and &quot;Bob-ize&quot; it into &quot;Hackerpreneur-Club-omics&quot; (hehe), by virtue of this one paragraph:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in good developers is such a good bet at the moment, that if you have money and you happen to find a talented developer who seems to like you and wants to work with you, you should give him/her your money to build something, anything, even if you have no really good product ideas (those are cheap; I&rsquo;ll sell you a dozen for a dollar).If you don&rsquo;t have money, you should offer up whatever other kind of surplus you do have. <strong>The NPV on a strong and positive relationship with a talented developer today is ridiculously high</strong>. If you gain the trust of a talented developer to the point that they are likely to drop any active gig in the future in favor of joining one of your projects, the value is through the roof. The world is your oyster, which you with your developer will open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPV = Net Present Value. The difference between the present value of a stream of cash inflows; and, the present value of a stream of cash outflows. Put another way: devs make you money. I&#39;ll be talking to Rastin and Ash about &quot;Hackerpreneur-nomics&quot; on this week&#39;s podcast at <a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs43\" target=\"_blank\">http://SouthLaSalleMedia.com/2011/tbbs43</a>. Here is the Forbes article:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There is a theory in evolutionary biology that reciprocal altruism and cooperation first appeared as a solution to the food storage problem. If you were an early hominid and you killed a large mammoth, you could not possibly eat it all before it rotted. So you shared it. The best bank for your excess capital was your friend&rsquo;s stomach. That way, you could play banker when your friend killed the next mammoth. I was thinking of this little idea recently in the context of human wealth. Unless you are a professional investor (and probably even then), places to store surplus capital today where it will even be safe and/or not depreciate too fast (let alone generate a return) are getting incredibly hard to find. The stock market seems to be a secular, bearish bloodbath. Volatility and unexpected temporary rallies are making short games dangerous. Even staying liquid in dollars seems to have its dangers, due to threats of devaluation and unfamiliar new terms like &ldquo;quantitative easing&rdquo; which us average investors are starting to hear for the first time. The Euro isn&rsquo;t exactly a great alternative at the moment. Investing in gold and similar commodities seems to require a somewhat apocalyptic mindset and decisions about whether or not you want access to the actual metal if things go to hell (which isn&rsquo;t to say such a mindset isn&rsquo;t justified at the moment). But there is one safe haven, if you know how to invest in it: software developers.\r\n<p>The Right Investment for Pre-Apocalyptic Times</p>\r\nThe one absolutely solid place to store your capital today &mdash; if you know how to do it &ndash; is in software developers&rsquo; wallets. If the world survives looming financial apocalypse dangers at all, this is the one investment that will weather the storms. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are an individual or a corporation, or what corner of the world you inhabit. You need to find a way to invest in software developers. In what follows, I am deliberately going to talk about the developers like they are products in a meat market. For practical purposes, they are, since the vast majority of them haven&rsquo;t found a way to use their own scarcity to their advantage. Which means others find a way to do so. In capitalism, every human is either a capitalist, somebody else&rsquo;s capital, or economically worthless. Today, this abstract point specifically translates to: people who can invest in developers, developers, and everybody else. This means that if you are in apparently more fundamental professions &mdash; perhaps you are a baker with a small business &mdash; you are effectively useless, not because bread isn&rsquo;t important, but because surviving in the bread business is now a matter of having developers on your side who can help you win in a game that Yelp, Groupon and other software companies are running to their advantage. If your bakery doesn&rsquo;t have an iPhone app, it will soon be at the mercy of outfits like Yelp. And god forbid, if you don&rsquo;t have a skill, like baking, which the developer-centric economy can actually use, you are in deep trouble. One reason the Occupy Wall Street movement is not having the impact it seems like it should, based on sheer numbers of people involved, is that many participants simply have no cards left to play in this national game of economic poker. We&rsquo;ll switch from this meat-market perspective to the humanist developer point of view at the end of the post. Investing in good developers is such a good bet at the moment, that if you have money and you happen to find a talented developer who seems to like you and wants to work with you, you should give him/her your money to build something, anything, even if you have no really good product ideas (those are cheap; I&rsquo;ll sell you a dozen for a dollar). If you don&rsquo;t have money, you should offer up whatever other kind of surplus you do have. <strong>The NPV on a strong and positive relationship with a talented developer today is ridiculously high. If you gain the trust of a talented developer to the point that they are likely to drop any active gig in the future in favor of joining one of your projects, the value is through the roof. The world is your oyster, which you with your developer will open.</strong> I warned you I was going to objectify and dehumanize programmers. On the flip side of the coin, I&rsquo;ve known people with complementary talents (such as raising money or marketing products) who return the loyalty in extreme ways &mdash; insisting on working with their trusted developers even if that means walking away from million dollar deals. But the rules of investing in developer capital are entirely different from the rules of investing in other types of human capital (a term due to economist A. W. Lewis, from 1953, at the peak of the industrial economy) or non-human capital assets. You do not stock up on programmers the same way you stock up on construction workers, soldiers, chemists, mechanical engineers, real estate or dollars (in fact, &ldquo;stocks&rdquo; is the wrong word, you have to think in terms of what John Hagel calls &ldquo;flows,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s a subtlety we&rsquo;ll ignore in this post, and stick to the stock metaphor). <strong>At the moment, the only thing potentially more valuable than a relationship with a great developer is a relationship with a survivalist who is good with things like guns, bunkers and cabins in woods (that&rsquo;s in case the apocalypse does come about in 2012, with bullets for currency). Which you think is the better bet depends on exactly how gloomy and bearish you are. I am pretty gloomy, but not yet gloomy enough to turn to survivalist capital investments.</strong> The entire software industry realizes this, and is building up a long position in quality software talent (emphasis on quality) as fast as possible, and by any means necessary, including large companies acquiring smaller ones purely for talent, with every intention of throwing away every other asset the acquisition brings in (lending a whole new meaning to the term &ldquo;talent acquisition.&rdquo;) As software eats the world and every company turns into a software company, people in other parts of the economy are slowly starting to understand what&rsquo;s going on and are belatedly trying to get in on the action. They will almost certainly fail unless they learn how to compete with the software industry itself. But more on that later.\r\n\r\n<p>The Anatomy of the Software Talent Wars</p>\r\nIn the midst of a thoroughly gloomy labor market, the genuine desperation you see in the software talent wars is almost surreal. Almost every day, I see big companies, little companies, entrepreneurs, wannabe entrepreneurs and even venture capitalists join in the hunt. The talent hunters infest LinkedIn, troll Quora, and trawl Facebook and Google+. Cartoons of homeless-looking CEOs holding up signs that say &ldquo;Looking for a technical co-founder&rdquo; are doing the rounds. Heck, I am one of these talent hunters (any star iOS developers out there interested in working with me?). Eager new angel investors are willing to throw money at any project that appears to involve a strong developer or two, trusting that even if the investment fails, having first shot at subsequent projects the talent gets into, will be worthwhile. Entire startups are being formed purely to keep good software teams together. Gilded-cage workplaces full of gourmet buffets, high-tech nap pods, and daycare facilities are just the tip of the iceberg. They are primarily mechanisms available to sufficiently large, Too Big to Fail software companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft. In a game where these majors set the bar in terms of cash and quality-of-life compensation, and very young startups set the bar in terms of providing realistic shots at big windfalls, no other type of business has any chance of really competing for top talent, with any mix of cash and stock it can conjure up. The talent wars actually play out on a much larger stage. The fight over the mind of a talented developer begins long before he or she even thinks about taking a paying job. Sometimes the fight begins in middle school. The reason is that the software industry, unlike almost any other, can get talent into its pipeline extremely early, by way of dominant programming languages, development environments, data and tools. A talented high-school kid who starts hacking away at an iPhone app at 14 is likely to stay in orbit around Apple for his/her entire career. A kid whose first programming stunt is a Google Maps mashup using other Google tools and APIs, is just as likely to stay in orbit around Google. A little known fact about Google, for instance, is that its investment in Python (one of the three languages the company uses for its work) was in part a strategic bet on an under-valued language, when it noticed that other companies were missing the growing talent pool in Python. The result is that cash-rich software majors, options-rich startups and relationship-rich industry insiders have been sucking up all available quality talent among them, leaving other industries and economic sectors starving. This is creating a have/have-not talent divide that is unprecedented. This divide will soon surpass the infamous geopolitical North/South divide in importance. No, I am not exaggerating. Why does the software industry buck the general trend of high unemployment (or at least the thriving part of it)? Is it a tech bubble? Yes and no. The actual technology markets being explored may well turn out to be a bubble, but to the extent that the investment is actually investment in people who will live out long careers in the sector, it is not. It is interesting to note that &ldquo;investing in people&rdquo; is so much the default mental model in the software industry that outliers such as Sequoia Capital, who consciously buck the trend, have to take pains to point out that they invest in markets and trends, not people or teams. In any other industry, this would go without saying. It is fairly clear, for instance, that the energy industry invests in promising energy markets and alternative-energy technology trends, not in energy experts. In other industries, investing in people is the exceptional strategy (such as Zappos in the shoe industry or Southwest in the airline industry). One reason this is the case is that software development talent is incredibly hard to assess upfront, and its value can be highly situation-dependent, which means intake volumes and intra-industry churn have to be high (since a potential star may not flourish in your environment). People risks are high enough that developing capabilities to deal with it becomes central to success. Traditional front-end mechanisms, such as universities, are not particularly good at creating or even spotting and nurturing star developer talent. To the point that industry luminaries like Peter Thiel are, rather mischievously, offering to pay truly talented developers to drop out of college and go the startup route instead. Another reason is that software skills are the most portable high-end skills on the planet. Spotting and temporarily attracting talent doesn&rsquo;t mean you get to keep it. Stock option-slavery and golden handcuffs for talent from acquired companies aside, there&rsquo;s not much you can do to combat social and economic mobility. Not only can software developers switch industries easily, they can even survive on their own much more easily. A nuclear engineer really cannot do much without nuclear reactors or bombs to work with. A biochemist needs a lab and a phalanx of lawyers who know how to deal with the FDA. A software developer on the other hand, can float free on the Internet, making money in mercenary ways, with no deep loyalties, if he/she so desires. Until the Internet shuts down, no other profession comes close in terms of the mobility it grants to those skilled in it.\r\n\r\n<p>But the most important reason is the 10x phenomenon.</p>\r\nThe thing is, software talent is extraordinarily nonlinear. It even has a name: the 10x engineer (the colloquial idea, originally due to Frederick Brooks, that a good programmer isn&rsquo;t just marginally more productive than an average one, but an order of magnitude more productive). In software, leverage increases exponentially with expertise due to the very nature of the technology. While other domains exhibit 10x dynamics, nowhere is it as dominant as in software. What&rsquo;s more, while other industries have come up with systems to (say) systematically use mediocre chemists or accountants in highly leveraged ways, the software industry hasn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s still a kind of black magic. One big reason is that other industries turn x&rsquo;ers into 10xers primarily using software tools (a mechanical engineer equipped with CAD software suddenly becomes a 10x mechanical engineer). While the world is full of tools that software engineers have built for themselves, the 10x phenomenon, and the industry&rsquo;s reliance on it, doesn&rsquo;t seem to get engineered or managed away. Because the 10xers keep inventing new tools for themselves to stay 10xers. This means that employment levels have to be higher, while 10xers are being discovered and put to good use.\r\n\r\n<p>Risk Management in Software Talent Investment</p>\r\nOn the flip side &mdash; and this doesn&rsquo;t have a name, perhaps it should be called the &ldquo;-10x effect&rdquo; &mdash; bad software developers aren&rsquo;t just a minor drag or inefficiency. For a variety of subtle reasons, they can be catastrophically toxic in a complex software system. A bad engineer writing dangerously buggy or ill-conceived software can create a ticking time-bomb that will cost thousands of times the original investment to clean up after, once it explodes. What&rsquo;s more, the clean-up effort will absorb the talents of many more good developers for a longer period of time. By contrast, incompetence and bad errors in domains like aerospace engineering are relatively more visible and easy to catch and fix early, before the costs escalate. Delayed crises (such as an aircraft model that develops a critical safety issue late in its career) are also much easier to contain, isolate and fix. The Y2K crisis wasn&rsquo;t even due to bad engineering. It was merely due to mediocre and pragmatic engineering. Imagine what bad engineering at the heart of today&rsquo;s software systems can cost to fix over decades. Worse, imagine the impact of talented 10xers who turn to the Dark Side (i.e., consciously turn into -100xers). Or good guys who leave backdoors open in systems they build, as insurance policies. The result is that investing in developer capital isn&rsquo;t just about hiring programmers and sorting them by talent. It is about sorting and allocating them into risk classes. Traditional talent managers simply don&rsquo;t think in terms of risk management and investment when it comes to human capital. If they are not thinking of human capital in purely commodity terms, they are at best thinking of it in terms of deterministic cost/benefit terms. A typical hiring manager will say things like &ldquo;the hiring costs for a position is equivalent to six months of the salary you plan to pay.&rdquo; This sort of book-keeping logic simply does not work for software engineers. Big software companies don&rsquo;t think this way. They manage sorting based on both talent and risk, and at the level of the entire industry and individual careers, rather than at the level of employment relationships. How do they do this?\r\n\r\n<p>The Lifecycle of Software Talent</p>\r\nFirst, big software companies invest very early in a large volume of prospects, by offering development tools and environments that can short-circuit the education system and snare talent as early as possible. Next, they keep the talent hooked via contests, scholarships, innovative internship models (such as Google&rsquo;s Summer of Code) and other pre-work-life mechanisms all the way through college. Then they hire a large number, watch performance and sort the talent based on the potential for returns and risk. They have to offer great buffets of course, but in addition, they have to build in incompetence insurance mechanisms to manage the damage bad software engineers can do. They have to invest in technologies (such as Google with Python) with an eye on talent rather than the marketplace. The relationship doesn&rsquo;t stop with employment. The software talent is so valuable that you pretty much have to set up open ecosystems (based on APIs, access to valuable data resources like mapping data, and open source elements) so you can keep them hooked to your broader technology universe even after they leave. An ex-Microsoft engineer is valuable anywhere in the economy if he voices support for buying Microsoft wherever he goes. As a developer ages, and finds it harder and harder to switch technologies, at some point, he or she is considered hooked for the rest of their natural lives to some technology &mdash; Java or C++ or the Facebook API say &mdash; that they can be expected to grow old with. When a technology hits that point of maturity, talent that&rsquo;s hooked to it starts getting devalued along with falling retention costs. The buffets become skimpier, compensation drops, churn is lowered, and the talent retires into the sunset with the technology. It&rsquo;s quite poignant really, like a crew going down with a ship. There are two exceptions to this end-of-life rule for software engineers and their ships. The really talented ones retain an evergreen ability to reinvent themselves around the latest, youngest technology layer, seemingly at will. The other exception is the Big Crisis exception. If a time-bomb planted by an incompetent in an old geological layer of software suddenly goes off, causing earthquakes that ripple up through newer layers, the grizzled veterans may find a sudden new market for their skills (we saw a little of that with Y2K, but fixing that mess didn&rsquo;t require much talent; one can conceive of more critical failures that will require getting retired heroes and heroines out of retirement, Armageddon style, to fix things). In other words, you not only have to start relationships with kids, you have to provide security and quality of life for the low-risk types who want houses, kids and great school districts, and an entrepreneurial opportunity space for those who itch to throw off managerial shackles and make their own way in the world. You have to cater to both risk-averse and gambler types. And you have to find ways to gracefully put the veterans out to pasture in much kinder (and more expensive) ways than in other fields, because they just might turn into your insurance policy if things blow up. Though this isn&rsquo;t yet an important dynamic, as the Boomers retire, and take with them a lot of knowledge of early geological layers of the software-eaten planet, managing risk around old software will turn into a major business. When the last veterans of the earliest still-in-use software layers start to die, we will be in historically unprecedented territory. If you pull all this off successfully, as a large software company, an investment in a young person at age 12 will yield returns for you throughout their lives, whether or not they work for you directly. They will start out as pure investments, start yielding dividends by age 18 or so, return your investment by age 30, provide business model insurance as your company matures (a major reason Java is still relevant, for instance, is that there is a ton of talent still invested in it), and eventually turn into crisis insurance policies (this by the way, is the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; you have to manage, as opposed to a &ldquo;stock&rdquo; of employees on your bench). Speaking of history, let&rsquo;s put all this in perspective for non-software-industry types who still don&rsquo;t understand just how epochal the birth of the software industry is for the rest of the economy.\r\n\r\n<p>Year 43 of Software Eating the World</p>\r\nAs Alan Kay, a major pioneer of today&rsquo;s software-eaten planet, pointed out recently, the Internet doesn&rsquo;t have stop, shut down, or rewind buttons. Once it was turned on, history was essentially rebooted. Software began eating away at the pre-software layers of civilization on the planet, and depositing software-infused layers instead. One of these days, we&rsquo;ll recognize the enormous significance of what&rsquo;s going on and replace the BC/AD distinction with BI/AI (Before Internet/After Internet), with January 1, Year 0 reset to October 29, 1969, the day the Internet was turned on (if you want to start right, 2012 is actually Year 43, AI). And yes, this time, there will be a Year 0, if programmers have anything to do with it. Which brings us to David Kirpatrick&rsquo;s now famous line that every company is now a software company. We are only just beginning to understand how software is now the core function of every company, no matter what it makes or what service it actually provides. So far, the rest of the economy has managed to live off whatever talent the software industry itself cannot soak up (for reasons ranging from talent not wanting to move to California to talent being interested in things other than software itself). In most non-software companies, developers have so far accepted a sort of second-class-citizen status despite their increasing scarcity and increasingly critical roles. That is about to change. As every company starts to re-organize around a recognition of the criticality of software to its business model, cataclysimic changes will ripple through the economy. To the extent that the growth of the base of software talent cannot keep up with demand, companies and entire industry sectors will start to collapse as they fail to adequately fuel their need for software talent. Those that survive will find themselves increasingly beholden to those with large amounts of developer capital. To the extent that you cannot run your own IT, Microsoft will run it for you. Even your non-software employees will effectively be controlled by the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook, who will set the bar for employee expectations via the direct-to-consumer software markets (this is the much-discussed &ldquo;consumerization of IT&rdquo; meme). Can the non-software sector compete at all? It&rsquo;s hard, but not impossible. The biggest bargaining chip other industries have is data. To fight the consumerization-of-IT force that comes in with your employees, and the Microsoftening of your business model that comes in via the IT department, your one weapon is access to data that is not about software. I&rsquo;ll write more about that another day. If you don&rsquo;t know how to use that one weapon you do possess, it will get taken away from you (the cartography, movie, music, news, publishing and restaurant retail industries have already learned this the hard way).\r\n\r\n<p>The View from the Talent Side</p>\r\nNobody likes being a commodity in a meat market, even as a highly valued 10x prime cut. If and when a human being who is also a valuable capital asset clues up about their his/her economic role, resistance begins. Software developers are smart. By and large the vast majority clue up, and do so relatively early. The clueless 10x developer who gets traded around with as little friction as stocks or cash is rare indeed. If you find one, resist the urge to exploit him/her for immediate gain, and invest in getting them clued up instead. You&rsquo;ll secure vastly more value in the form of relationship capital that way. The natural reaction that forms once a good developer recognizes his/her own value is to turn to either an individualist-mercenary mindset or a collectivist guild-like mindset. The individualists turn into hard bargainers as they carefully probe their own market value and frequently re-negotiate relationships. They carefully invest in keeping their skill-base current and avoiding being shunted into the sunset end of the ecosystem for as long as possible. This sort of developer likes to hedge bets, stay invested in multiple projects and keep one foot in the open source world at all times. They position themselves for massive upsides when that is a possibility, and the ability to walk away from failures with their own reputations intact where there is real risk. There is a reason star mercenary technical talent is the asset that gets sold fastest in a fire-sale when a startup crashes. There is a mad scramble for a CTO who successfully manages to blame the business end for the failure. The other kind of developer turns to guild-like structures, which serve as centers of balance-of-power politics in the constant wars against the developer-capitalists. Except that instead of taking on the dynamics of class warfare along an upper-lower dimension, the conflict takes the form of exit warfare along an inside-outside dimension. Rather than form a union to negotiate with management, the talented developer will simply exit a situation he/she does not like, and use guild-like resources to move to a better situation. Stock options are simply not as effective in limiting mobility as the power of Russian nobility to whip serfs into immobility once was. The result is a precarious balance of power between developers and developer-capitalists, and a cyclic center-periphery flow of developer-capital, as individual developers take themselves in and out of circulation. The result is a new kind of economics: Welcome to the world of Developeronomics.</blockquote>\r\n', '<p>Earlier this month, Forbes&#39; contributor Venkatesh Rao published an interesting column at Forbes.com titled, &quot;The Rise of Developeronomics&quot;...</p>\r\n', '<p>Earlier this month, Forbes&#39; contributor Venkatesh Rao published an interesting column at Forbes.com titled, &quot;The Rise of Developeronomics&quot;...</p>\r\n', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/hackerprenomics-the-forbes-article', 'investments1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2011-12-13', '2011-12-13 15:00:00', 1, '2011-12-13 15:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

This is because convention has left us frustrated, yearning for code!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we approach our own code development conventionally, then why will we avoid the ailments and pathologies we are seeking to avoid?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1, section 1.1 of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2012/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=67:introducing-continuous-integration\" target=\"_blank\">Jenkins: The Definitive Guide</a>&rdquo; opens:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In fact it is a real game changer &ndash; when Continuous Integration is introduced into an organization, it radically alters the way teams think about the whole development process&hellip; going from a simple scheduled automated build right through to continuous delivery into production.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Circumventing the Joomla installer is a liberating idea. Using &ldquo;automated builds&rdquo; to created hundreds of simultaneous versions has a lot of value. Thinking of software development as &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; processes opens up a lot of value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My original idea was to run a club of Tienda clients, so my clients could share the costs of common modifications. The software development process extended to maintaining a custom Distro of Tienda. Since the only one working on this Distro was, essentially, just me, what process did we need? Much time was spent on Live Update, so my clients can effortlessly grab the latest and greatest version.<br />\r\nWell, here we are, at what is the logical conclusion of our journey: that we have to be in the Joomla extension business. We have to create/maintain our own Joomla ecommerce software. This is an entirely different proposition than being in the modifications business.<br />\r\nThe last thing I want to do is recreate the problems my clients and I are escaping &ndash; principally, vapourware. So, if a &ldquo;solid development plan&rdquo; means &ldquo;tell me when your features will be released&rdquo;, then I don&rsquo;t see the point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, our list of features is vast. Practically bottomless. We are starved for features. It&rsquo;s one thing to be the &ldquo;mouse on the wheel&rdquo; for a finite amount of customizations; but, it&rsquo;s an entirely different thing faced with practically an infinite amount of programming using a ton of programmers for a wide spectrum of site owners and consultants. The question is not &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;when&rdquo;. The real question is &ldquo;how&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researching &ldquo;how&rdquo; unearthed surprises. There is a world of opportunity in the &ldquo;how&rdquo;. The &ldquo;how&rdquo; is where the real value is. As consultants and site owners, we can customize the &ldquo;how&rdquo; to suit our purposes. The right to change the code has led us to owning our software development process. Which leads us to Continuous Integration, which is involves testing and building. It is the building that we will blaze a trail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Within an hour of publishing my latest “The Moneyball of Joomla ecommerce“ podcast, I received a tweet asking me why anyone would “invest” in my thing without a “solid development plan”...', 'Within an hour of publishing my latest “The Moneyball of Joomla ecommerce“ podcast, I received a tweet asking me why anyone would “invest” in my thing without a “solid development plan”...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/an-imperfect-understanding-of-where-features-come-from', 'moneyball1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2012-02-11', '2012-02-11 15:00:00', 1, '2012-02-11 15:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

A long journey over a very long bridge high above the water. It&rsquo;s not as if I&rsquo;m going to make a u-turn, or swerve to the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think CSS is mind-numbing, then you&rsquo;re really going to glaze-eye on me about software builds. It is uber-geeky. There is no pretense that a non-techie will use it. It&rsquo;s a journey into geek-land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surveying the dev@Cloud Jenkins service, I asked myself &ldquo;What the hell am I doing?&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had no occassion to get into this stuff &rsquo;til now, so what am I doing here? Can this really be the Moneyball of Joomla ecommerce?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it really is the Moneyball of Joomla ecommerce. This is where the techies see real value. This is techie stuff created by techies for techies for the express purpose of creating value in the development process. It&rsquo;s to make things easier, to avoid doing repetitive tasks, to reduce bugs, to increase the quality of the code, to deploy code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s a techie thing. The last thing this part of the techie world expects is &ldquo;users&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s exactly what we are doing. We, site owners and consultants, are driving our Alfa Romeo&rsquo;s across that great bridge into the golden roadway to RoI. They are not expecting us there, where the shock on the faces of the techies will be clear on their faces. The last thing they expect here are users from the wrong side of the bridge usurping the very technology that creates immense value for their software development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many tools of the trade, these tools are FOSS.

It needs&nbsp;<em>a lot</em>&nbsp;of elbow grease though!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuous Integration technology used by lowly &ldquo;users&rdquo;, put together by lowly &ldquo;users&rdquo;, for the benefit of lowly &ldquo;users&rdquo;, is the heart of unlocking RoI for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what I thought as I went travelled through software build technology, having crossed the bridge, was that this is a land that we have to live in. And, by living in it, there really is no border between &ldquo;extension purveyor&rdquo; and &ldquo;user&rdquo;. We are in the extension business, even though we are &ldquo;users&rdquo;. So, from code origination to our individual production websites, it&rsquo;s one big integrated process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought that the demarcation between &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; in the software development process is that point where it crosses into the individual website. Ah, but we are the extension purveyor! So, it&rsquo;s moot. We are Vertically Integrated. We are engaged in all aspects of the software development process. Origination, testing, building, deploying&hellip; there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;they&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all &ldquo;we&rdquo; now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, it takes my breath away. Controlling the code, which is the underlying premise of the GPL, is just part of it. To truly control the code, you have to hold the software development process in the palm of your hand. That means crossing the bridge into geek-land for Continous Integration, the soul of the software development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Github.com does not release software!&nbsp;<a href=\"http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html\" target=\"_blank\">They deploy continuously, daily</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t really have &ldquo;releases&rdquo; because we deploy to production every day &ndash; often several times a day. We can do so through our chat room robot, which is the same place our CI results are displayed. We try to make the process of testing and shipping as simple as possible so that every employee feels comfortable doing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of advantages to deploying so regularly. If you deploy every few hours, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to introduce large numbers of big bugs. Little issues can be introduced, but then they can be fixed and redeployed very quickly. Normally you would have to do a &lsquo;hotfix&rsquo; or something outside of the normal process, but it&rsquo;s simply part of our normal process &ndash; there is no difference in the GitHub flow between a hotfix and a very small feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another advantage of deploying all the time is the ability to quickly address issues of all kinds. We can respond to security issues that are brought to our attention or implement small but interesting feature requests incredibly quickly, yet we can use the exact same process to address those changes as we do to handle normal or even large feature development. It&rsquo;s all the same process and it&rsquo;s all very simple.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Hotfix is really a Very Small Feature? Well, there is a true understanding where ecommerce profits come from! Profits come from features. Features come from code. That code must actually exist and reside &mdash; and work! &mdash; on your website. Your focus should be on buying revenue; and, in order for you to buy revenue, you buy features. To buy features, you buy code. Moneyball: You don&rsquo;t buy players, you should be buying wins. And to buy wins, you need to buy runs. Value is not planning or having star programmers, which are over-valued (Alan will disagree). Value is having real code working for real on your actual website. No technology, no profit! Deploying every day &mdash; it&rsquo;s a culture shock!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implications! If you deploy everyday, then do you run big massive discrete projects? Wouldn&rsquo;t we be running a continuous stream of small projects? Wouldn&rsquo;t we want to run a ton of concurrent small projects? We&rsquo;d have to find a way to start and finish projects, as we&rsquo;d be starting and concluding projects all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theoretically, at least, revenue from the sites under our purview would be growing incrementally, as features were added incrementally every day. A portion of this growing revenue would be, theoretically, re-invested into software development, resulting in more features that create more revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things I learned at tonight&rsquo;s Toronto Joomla meet-up is that there&rsquo;s some Continuous Integration skill amongst my Founding Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We really are crossing the bridge. No u-turns, no swerving.

There is no glamour in testing. But, there is tremendous value in testing. And extracting that value is what attracts us to testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing is a major PITA. It&rsquo;s easier to be casual about it. The problem with casual is that your live site becomes one huge test facility. Live sites cannot be fully simulated in tests, but doing as much testing as possible before the code hits your live site increases your chances of enjoying a smooth running, money-making live site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Alan Langford told me, it takes time and effort to set up testing. You have to code so that your code is test-able. The reward is two-fold: quality increases hugely which reduces your operational risk; and, subsequent testing becomes easier as the initial testing set-up is done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since testing is not glamourous, is not glorious, is usually thankless, and delays code getting to market, it&rsquo;s not only glossed over but it&rsquo;s a skill that only a subset of programmers have. Indeed, a &ldquo;somewhat specialized skill&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>As of February 2010, a tests folder has been added to the Joomla! SVN download. This folder contains a growing library of unit and system (or functional) tests. The unit tests use PHPUnit and the system tests use PHPUnit and Selenium. The unit tests perform tests primarily on the Joomla! framework. The Selenium system tests actually run Joomla! from a browser and test it as a user would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.joomla.org/Running_Automated_Tests_for_Version_1.6\" target=\"_blank\">http://docs.joomla.org/Running_Automated_Tests_for_Version_1.6</a>x</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmmm, does this mean that such testing was not part of Joomla 1.0 &amp; Joomla 1.5? The implication is that the value of such testing is recognized to exceed its costs only recently. Regardless of when this recognition occurred, we should take the hint at Club Commerce!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I cannot emphasize enough that controlling the software development process offers massive RoI. Open source software gives us the right to control the code. But the huge value resides in the development process. That&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Moneyball&rdquo; aspect &mdash; the conventional wisdom is that the value is with the code. But the true value is the development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a testing regimen, we can hire a ton of different programmers for a ton of different projects. The programmers code, and then we run their code through our tests. Code that passes is integrated into our codebase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need an explosion of features. So, our software development process must allow us to program an explosion of features. Up-front investment in testing allows us to achieve an explosion of testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing is a road less travelled, but rich in value. The Jenkins Server is mostly about testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no idea how deeply Alan Langford, a Founding Member, is involved with testing:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Ground work on the implementation of unit testing has been done by Enno Klasing during the Summer of Code 2007 project and has been&nbsp;<strong>perfected by Alan Langford</strong>&nbsp;from the Joomla! Development Team.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.joomla.org/index.php?title=Development_Working_Group&amp;oldid=62385\" target=\"_blank\">http://docs.joomla.org/index.php?title=Development_Working_Group&amp;oldid=62385</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is going to make your eyes glaze over:<a href=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.pear.devel/43667\" target=\"_blank\">http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.pear.devel/43667</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, after we&nbsp;<a href=\"http://southlasallemedia.com/2012/tbbs47\" target=\"_blank\">recorded our &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo; interview</a>, we chatted for a half hour about LaSalleMart and testing. Alan agreed to do a special one-on-one podcast on testing and LaSalleMart, which we&rsquo;ll do in March. What prompted this post-show interview was something Alan said off-the-cuff at the recent Toronto Joomla meet-up about testing &mdash; which had nothing to do with Club Commerce or LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing is something I did in a former life as a Business Analyst. Use-case testing, mostly, where you dream up phony numbers, manually calculate what the computer is supposed to spit out, then see if the system actually outputs those numbers. Well, we can do &ldquo;use case&rdquo; testing in automated tests, saving the hassle of foisting it onto end users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we have a valuable testing skill-set here at Club Commerce. As much as I yearn for all the pet projects that are piling on already to be coded, I am going to devote myself to constructing the test environment. If this takes a couple of months, so be it, because the payoff is massive. We are going to be leaders in testing and Continuous Integration, with the payoff being the ability to accomodate an explosion of features &mdash; and getting this quality code to your sites so you can make money with these features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very interesting, and exciting, to put other extensions through our testing before you install them on your site. This is completely in keeping with the idea that GPL software is Raw Material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m rushing this blog post, because I want to squeeze it in before publishing my already-late&nbsp;<a href=\"http://southlasallemedia.com/2012/lasallemart5\" target=\"_blank\">February Hangout podcast</a>. So a few observations&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to bring an explosion of features to your live site, we need a software development process that accomodates a massive amount of programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This software development process, by definition, cannot be like the process other extension purveyors use &mdash; because those processes have left us yearning for features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the road well travelled has left us frustrated, then the road less travelled is where the pot of gold is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people do not like to travel on the roads less travelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Club Commerce is for site owners and consultants who realize they need to travel on the road less travelled. With 140 memberships available, this is not a mass marketed club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Moneyball&rdquo; attitude leads us to probe where the value really resides. We identify where the value really resides; and, then we become skilled at these things that build value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, we&rsquo;ve concluded that coding is over-rated!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The software development process is where the value is. And, the soul of value is Continuous Integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuous Integration = test + build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing is a &ldquo;somewhat specialized skill&rdquo; &mdash; relatively few coders are skilled at testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Build&rdquo; has led us to the shocking conclusion of abandoning the Joomla installer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fallacy of the One Big Zip file!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a surprising competency in testing at Club Commerce. The Toronto Joomla Group, of which we participate, has an unusual competency in testing. So, Club Commerce will be a leader in testing; and, in building ( = Continuous Integration).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, despite an initial up-front investment of time/effort creating a CI environment, the payoff will be an explosion of features for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of programmers. Hiring programmers should be easy. We will need money to hire programmers to code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is a funding model to hire programmers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s an article about GitHub.com called &ldquo;Lord of the Files&rdquo; (clever!) at<a href=\"http://m.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1</a>.

We aren&rsquo;t waiting for CI to be mainstream, we are all over this thing now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using CI means doing Joomla differently. We&rsquo;re blazing this trail. It&rsquo;s called Leadership!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book&rsquo;s author is described as:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The computer scientist (Diplom-Informatiker) is a co-founder of thePHP.cc and a pioneer in the field of quality assurance in PHP projects. His testing framework, PHPUnit, is a de facto standard.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I can&rsquo;t get over the comments!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate, however, that the book is so brief, because much more detail could&rsquo;ve been provided about the way the tools are best used, especially the meaning of the different metrics included in the various static code analysis tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I admit freely that I get frustrated many times by the needless fluff to tech books that appears to be added to books for additional page count. This book has been stripped of almost all fluff, and there needs to be some fluff to provide readers with padded surface to guide them through new information. Readers may benefit from reading the conclusion first.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Rushing a book to market to stake first claim to technical bona fides to bolster a consulting business? Maybe &mdash; I can be rather cynical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, this is a nascent area that is growing: CI and PHP. Soon to be CI and Joomla. There is no book on this. We will write this book ourselves. What is different is that our point-of-view is site-owners, and not extension purveyors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said in my &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2012/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=86:late-night-thoughts-on-lasallemart\" target=\"_blank\">Late Night Thoughts on LaSalleMart</a>&rdquo; post (with pic of Dustin Hoffman driving on the Golden Gate Bridge):</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Surveying the dev@Cloud Jenkins service, I asked myself &ldquo;What the hell am I doing?&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had no occassion to get into this stuff &rsquo;til now, so what am I doing here? Can this really be the Moneyball of Joomla ecommerce?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it&nbsp;<strong>really is the Moneyball of Joomla ecommerce</strong>. This is<strong>where the techies see real value</strong>. This is techie stuff created by techies for techies for the express purpose of creating value in the development process. It&rsquo;s to make things easier, to avoid doing repetitive tasks, to reduce bugs, to increase the quality of the code, to deploy code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s a techie thing.&nbsp;<strong>The last thing this part of the techie world expects is &ldquo;users&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s exactly what we are doing. We, site owners and consultants, are driving our Alfa Romeo&rsquo;s across that great bridge into the golden roadway to RoI. They are not expecting us there, where the shock on the faces of the techies will be clear on their faces.

Since VM does not have this feature, we needed a program, and chose iDev. When someone buys in VM, the thank you page throws off a URL to iDev, which then inserts a record into the idevaff_sales table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, my client is paying $29.99USD per month for the hosting, which is just a reseller account. You can get the Hostgator &ldquo;Business&rdquo; hosting with SSL for $15USD/month. Or, just use your current Hostgator account, add-on a new domain, spend $50/year for SSL, and you have $250 left over. Now, this is not insignificant, you&rsquo;ll see!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iDev is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;open source. Nothing I did touched iDev. Instead, I used external PHP with CRON to modify the &ldquo;payment&rdquo; field in the &ldquo;idevaff_sale&rdquo; table. That is, I over-wrote the iDev commission calculations with my custom calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time we mess around on the margins of this program, we could have put that energy into a real commission program of our own. How many hours did it take me to figure out iDev, and how to run my own &ldquo;API&rdquo; script against the database? Lots. And, now, how much time have I spent investigating and testing a problem. The problem is the lack of usability of my handiwork, because there are no admin for what I did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend 10 hours in total messing around, and instead we could have started our own affilate program. The time saved by not using someone else&rsquo;s reseller account, plus what I bill, plus what a few other Club Commerce Members chip in, and voila, we have $2,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are open source affiliate solutions out there, so we can modify what&rsquo;s there, or just absorb ideas. It would be very interesting to attach the payout features with the payment step in checkout &mdash; en route to making an ecomm platform of sorts, rather than each individual thing have all the elements of checkout. Anyways, the point is that there are open source affiliate software that can potentially save us time/money building our own custom affilate LaSalleMart solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attaching this affilate solution to our Continuous Development process means we don&rsquo;t have to build all features all at once. As new features are in demand, we build those. Not for fWhile banging my head against the wall with this thing, I realized here is a classic reason why us consultants and site owners banding together is so darn lucrative.ree, new features need paid programmers. But, you got the basics and that provided RoI. Now, new incremental features bring incremental revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the thing that I am really trying to get across is that &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; modifications are brutally expensive. For what we spend on post-installation feature building, we could build our own thing from scratch, bring the bulk of development back &ldquo;downstream&rdquo;, have a bunch of people share the cost of development, and make more money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the effort we are lavishing on an itty bitty piece of the affiliate software, we could have asked a bunch of people needing affiliate software to chip in top-up money and built a more powerful, more friendly, more relevant affiliate features.

The software; or, the process that creates it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He responded with: the software!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To which I said, &ldquo;you are more right than me!&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need something to install for our clients, now.&nbsp; We need to kick-start conversion to Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have my two tax components, along with my Distro &amp; my Control Centre component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have Akeeba Live Update set-up with its dedicated website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we&rsquo;re going to bootstrap everything together. So much for a linear path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re starting with my Tienda 0.8.2 Distro. The first thing I&rsquo;m doing is getting checkout back to &ldquo;First Principles&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Checkout has caused me a lot of grief, and it needs some fixing before proceeding. I&rsquo;m taking it back to basic, step-by-step &ldquo;First Principles&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve created a separate view for each step, and a separate display function in the controller for each view. It&rsquo;s a good foundation for the changes I know are coming!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, there are things to delete. A motivator to get Tienda lean-and-mean is converting to Joomla 2.5. The less code that exists, the less code to convert. So, all references to Dioscouri extensions will be deleted. All modules and plugins will be omitted from the base installation, so we can delete the Tienda installation routine. We&rsquo;ll review the code to see what else we can jettison; or, separate out to convert later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be a California package, and a Canadian package. The Canadian package will include Canada Post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BTW: LaSalleMart Canada is created and maintained by Canadians for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything will be installable via the Joomla installer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what are we going to do with LaSalleMart 1.0?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, we, who are bootstrapping LaSalleMart, are Joomla ecommerce consultants frustrated with traditional cart extensions. We don&rsquo;t want to merely recreate what is already out there. All we&rsquo;ll achieve is recreating our frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want massively huge amounts of features. We want a software development process that can accomodate massively huge amounts of features. We want to accomodate a huge amount of investment &mdash; as feature sponsorship is attracted to LaSalleMart, we must have the ability to properly absorb that investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to get our new features onto our live sites fast. No, really! This is a major reason for undertaking LaSalleMart in the first place. There are ways!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to produce multiple simultaneous versions of LaSalleMart &mdash; one size does not fit all, so why should we limit ourselves to just one version?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to get your development efforts and dollars back downstream into core development. There&rsquo;s far too much post-development, redundant &ldquo;beyond-the-install&rdquo; work being done, that could and should be pushed back downstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what will I do with LaSalleMart? Ha! How &rsquo;bout what I will&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;do with LaSalleMart: give it away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are interested to use LaSalleMart. So support it with a subscription.

Thank you Zach!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPDATE WHILST I INPUT MY POSTS INTO MY LARAVEL APP: And pp your ass too for going suddenly quiet and dropping off the face of the earth. But, also, thank you, because I&#39;ve been so reticent about partnering with people with my software. Which has caused me succeed even more with my own sofware -- LaSalleMart 3.0 was my from-scratch innovation. Now three months in with the Laravel Framework, my pace of independent learning has accelerated, doing a from-scratch blog app -- just the beginning!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Converting Tienda 0.8.2 to LaSallemart is forcing me to explore crevices of the code I&rsquo;ve not explored before. Thank you to everyone who brought Tienda to fruition. It&rsquo;s been an interesting experience journeying through the codebase, re-living the excitement I felt when it first came out, understanding yet again why I saw so much promise; yet, at the same time, getting a deeper perspective on my frustration too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That Dioscouri blog entry keeps popping up in my mind that says &ldquo;You can change the code&rdquo;. Yes, we can, and yes we are.&nbsp; But, I&rsquo;ll tell you something, there&rsquo;s more to changing the code than &ldquo;changing the code&rdquo;. And in my chats &amp; emails with Zach, I keep coming back to it. It&rsquo;s about control. It feels so good to get into the code! Even better, instead of worrying about &ldquo;not disturbing the core&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s great to have the core by the balls!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diving into the core of Tienda&rsquo;s checkout felt really good. I&rsquo;ve dealt tangentally with checkout, not wanting to disturb the core, which produced frustrating results. My goal was to return checkout back to &ldquo;First Principles&rdquo;, as the foundation for further modifications. My checkout is step-by-step. No guest checkout, no one-page checkout. Nothing fancy, and try not to use javascript. A grinding experience it was to achieve this without disturbing the underlying code, but in the end got it. To achieve all the fancy changes, I think we will have to go back to &ldquo;First First Principles&rdquo;, which is a topic for another post. Now there&rsquo;s a clean step-by-step checkout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the back of my mind is converting to Joomla 2.5.&nbsp; LaSalleMart 1.0 will be for Joomla 1.5 only. Instead of doing some prep for the conversion now, I&rsquo;m deferring all that so I can get LM1 out-the-door. As Bugs Bunny says, &ldquo;Foist things foist&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be&nbsp;<em>three simultaneous LM 1.0 packages</em>: Canadian (eh!), California, and regular unleaded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada Post will be done after the first round is done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each package will have it&rsquo;s own Live Update, so you can update LM in Joomla 2.5 style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am merging elements of my Tax and Distro-Control components into the single LM component to save the trouble of installing multiple components. However, in the doing, I am becoming resistant because I&rsquo;m stuffing more things into the base admin, which I hate. The admin is busy enough without cramming more stuff in there. The way to go is be a bit expedient, b/c it&rsquo;s more important to convert to Joomla 2.5 than to add things to this Joomla 1.5 version of LM1.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be no LaSalleMart website &mdash; for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some reason that was not apparent at 2:00am last night, installation is halting at the plugins.

The results speak for themselves: not one, but three simultaneous software packages. The code for each package resides in exactly one place &mdash; there&rsquo;sbuild-more-profound-than-the-code no duplicate code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we can view code by how we create it. And in so doing, we can improve the code we create, and speed up its creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let me tell you the deep dark secret of how I created three simultaneous ecommerce packages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I installed a powerful, mature, mainstream, and FREE &ldquo;build&rdquo; program, called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.phing.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Phing</a>;</li>\r\n	<li>I created a (nearly) FREE account at one of the world&rsquo;s most respected and popular source code repository sites, called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>;</li>\r\n	<li>I forgot that it was dinnertime.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I chunked up the code into a bunch of different GitHub &ldquo;repositories&rdquo;, and Phing assembled the code into the final packages. It took me half a week to create the seven Phing files that merge the repos, process the merged PHP, create the installable zip, and upload to my server&rsquo;s download folders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, when I finish a round of mods, I update the GitHub repos, and then run my seven Phing build files one-after-the-after. Voila, my three gorgeous flavours of LaSalleMart are sitting on my server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One-size-fits-all zip files are complete a waste of time. Instead, using established, powerful, mainstream &mdash; and FREE &mdash; tools, I present to you a taste of personal turn-key Joomla ecommerce solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tell me, why shouldn&rsquo;t a bunch of enterprising consultants and site owners get together and make the most of the tools that are out there. I mean, geez, I come back to this all the time, why behave like a bunch of individuals doing one-off customizations? Why not be smart and band together instead? Do our custom coding as a team, share the code amongst ourselves, and come out ahead? Well, why not take it to massive heights, and utilize the free mainstream powerful build tools out there to create eye-popping custom kick-ass ecomm features for ourselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those in the User Community who are growing our own consultancies and sites, who are engaged in custom mods already, who can rub two nickels together, the potential is stunning. Let&rsquo;s push custom coding back downstream, chunk up the code into discrete repositories, and then get Phing to assemble and upload the code to our sites. What I&rsquo;ve said all these months and months is really possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we&rsquo;re &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; our code instead of storing it in one big blog, we can &ldquo;chunk out&rdquo; the code creation process too. We create temporary &ldquo;Feature Teams&rdquo; to create very specific features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phing (and the Jenkins Server) can automate code testing (well, some of it!), documentation, and deployment. We will have a potent software creation &amp; maintenance process for ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y&rsquo;know, we don&rsquo;t actually have to code. There&rsquo;s too much coding to do for any one or two or three people to do anyways. What we&rsquo;ll have is a way for lots of hired programmers to code at the same time. Creating a feature will not be a matter of deciding yea-or-nay, but a matter of gathering the Feature Team and getting started. That is, no one will be gatekeeping features that have funders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people in the Joomla ecommerce User Community want to consume software. They have no interest in creating or maintaining it. They just want to use it. The marketplace is serving this software-to-be-consumed group quite well. However, there is a segment of the Joomla ecommerce User Community who do not merely consume software, who are engaged in the software development process in some form. It is you whom I make this call to action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability for the User Community to maintain &amp; create their own software is here. To you, the enterprising consultant and site owner growing your businesses, to you I say: join. Uncross your arms, and join. The only way we can make the most out of the &ldquo;build&rdquo; software is by being on both sides of the Joomla installer &mdash; being the extension purveyor; and, owning the live web sites. The Joomla installer is the Great Divide, and we have the unique position and opportunity of being on both sides. Being on both sides is where the real money is. You see what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join my Club Commerce with the idea that in a month or two you can chip in an extra $100/month to hire programmers. 200 Club Members chipping in a mere $100/month = $240,000 in pure programming annually. That&rsquo;s major money, and you get the benefit of all that code. We do have to build up our capacity to absorb all this investment in code, and we will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve described this already in great detail. I&rsquo;ve told you in detail how we should proceed. I&rsquo;ve told you in detail why using a social site as our Members-only site is superior to traditional ticket &amp; forum sites. Now, we have LaSalleMart 1.0, which put theory into practice. We&rsquo;re ready to rock-and-roll.</p>\r\n', 'More profound than the code is the way I built my simultaneous packages, because there is huge money to the User Community in waking up to how to build code.

It&#39;s beta or not. Production means &quot;real&quot;. The terms do not belong side-by-side.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we come across a problem, we don&rsquo;t know if we encountered a known &lt;100% functional feature; or, if it&rsquo;s a problem in a =100%. &nbsp;Enabling product reviews impaired site performance on pages whose products have attributes. Are in 100% or &lt;100% territory here? Well, we definitely disabled product reviews, and site performance improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AkeebaBackup.com&rsquo;s Akeeba Release System&rsquo;s Live Update feature failed User Testing. This is a must-have feature, so we can update LaSalleMart in the Joomla Administrator. We plan on having a lot of releases (en route to eventual Continuous Deployment), so it would sure be convenient to do the updates within Joomla. That&rsquo;s how Joomla 2.5 does it now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I ended up re-jigging installation/update to accomodate Live Update. It&rsquo;s done. In so doing, though, I had to replicate installation/update code in all three &ldquo;flavour&rdquo; repositories, in order to accommodate the Joomla installer. This should be the only time ev-ah that we replicate code among the LaSalleMart repositories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While I was re-jigging the installation, I took the liberty of increasing the default config options from 5 records to 215 records (give or take).

The solution was to customize this particular drop-down for Canadian HST/PST/GST, because the generic handling made no sense at all &mdash; and the drop-down as-is introduced an error. It&rsquo;s the first time I introduced specific Canadianization to the product details form, and I love it! This is exactly what I&rsquo;m trying to achieve, a Canuck Cart! We&rsquo;ll probably have to do something similar for LaSalleMart California when we do our first install.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We now have another Toronto install on the way &mdash; Canada Post is needed for this one.

In fact, LaSalleMart is so primed now that I have to do marketing full time (methinks) in order to get Membership from basically zero to 250-300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I&rsquo;ve not yet completed my Canada Post shipping plugin and my PayPal Pro tweaks, I am going to hold them in abeyance for now and spend my technical time on the Joomla 2.5 conversion. After meeting Zach in person this week &mdash; a perfect late summer afternoon at St. Lawrence Market area &mdash; we&rsquo;ve come up with our approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you something: if I had more Members, I&rsquo;d be aggressive soliciting ideas and stimulating discussion about this, because there&rsquo;s more than meets the eye here. Zach is basically representing future Members, and as such I wanted to meet with him personally, and flesh out a decision tree on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line is that we decided that TIME is the most important project element (4 basic project constraints: time, cost, scope, quality &ndash;&gt; pick 2!). This is where the Tienda caveat above entered our thinking? Why convert features that are &lt; 100%? The purpose of my Club is to create &amp; maintain our own Joomla ecommerce software, so we&rsquo;re going to DIY anyways within my Club. So, let&rsquo;s amputate code. The less code, the less to convert to Joomla 2.5, the faster we can do it. That&rsquo;s the theory!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is to aggressively amputate features and code. Lean and mean. Maybe too lean. But, we&rsquo;ll rebuild LaSalleMart up in our image. The conversion to Joomla 2.5 marks the first discrete break from Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Custom fields, product comments, product reviews, subscription products, the dashboard reports, guest checkout, one page checkout are for sure to be deleted. Most of the plugins and modules will initially be ignored. The system plugin over-rides com_user, so I&rsquo;m basically hoping to ditch this plugin completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using multiple GitHub.com repos and Phing for building the three LaSalleMart zip files are a tremendous success. After the final commit, it takes less than 10 minutes to get the three new fresh completed zip files uploaded for downloaded AND ready for your Live Updating. With the pressure of our first live site upon us, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing (after I did my re-jigging for Live Update). It works for real. We have multiple specific &ldquo;jurisdictional&rdquo; editions of LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is real, is viable, is ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long grinding road to get to this point is done. Now, we absolutely need to get Membership popped to 250 to 300 to realize the potential of what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n', 'WHILE INPUTTING MY WORDPRESS POSTS TO MY LARAVEL BLOG APP (Aug 2014): I cannot friggin\' believe the shit I went through to fork this overhead-laden thing -- BUT I DID.

LU allows you to update LaSalleMart from your Joomla Administrator, instead of trudging to my download site, logging in, downloading, etc etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It really works. There&rsquo;s an icon in the LaSalleMart dashboard that tells you if you have the latest version. If not, you click to the update page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my end of things, every time I have an update, I have to go to my ARS admin and fill out forms. Which is fine if I have one new release every week or two. But, what happens when I have a new release daily? Or even &mdash; gasp! &mdash; more than one per day? Then, it&rsquo;s a major PITA to update the ARS admin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new release per day? You betcha! If I make one small change &mdash; which I did late this afternoon &mdash; why wait to release it? Philosophically, I want all LaSalleMart sites to have my changes asap. Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment &mdash; the key word is &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GitHub.com is great. We update the repo(s), and the code is ready for Phing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phing is proving to be so powerful that I&rsquo;m starting to consider it a weapon. Once the LaSalleMart repositories are PUSHed, it takes mere minutes to get all three LaSalleMart flavours uploaded to the Akeeba Release System folders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, updating my ARS admin is proving to be a bottleneck. In fact, knowing I have to update it has caused me to delay running my Phing builds. This is a Very Bad Behaviour: the antithesis of &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Joomla installer a bottleneck. Not just physically; but, it is a nasty limiting mindset. I have Grand Plans to bypass the Joomla installer completely. However, in the here-and-now, we are using the Joomla installer; and, using ARS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, after achieving &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; with GitHub and Phing, how to I overcome the ARS bottleneck? Well, did I mention that Phing is very powerful?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phing does databases. Phing can talk to the ARS database directly. The Phing task is called &ldquo;pdosqlexec&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Phing UPDATEs the ARS database directly. &nbsp;Look Ma, no Administrator! Bada Bing, Phing uploads the new ZIP files, and then does the UPDATEs right after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I cheated. As Nicholas will probably read this, I better fess up! Phing UPDATEs #__ars_releases only. I don&rsquo;t bother adding brand new releases, I just pretend that my latest ZIPs are the very first releases. Saves a lot of bother this way, although not what ARS intends. Well, I use ARS as a conduit between code origination and final upstream code, rather than a software release mechanism. It&rsquo;s<em>continuous deployment</em>, baby!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up tweaking manifest.xml and defines.php (and a few other things). Most fun reserved for phiguring out Phing. A journey learning how-to set up the automation. But, whooooooaaaa, now that I have the automation in place, it sings!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart updates can be on your site within 10 minutes of the GitHub update. With the automation, I have no extra steps with the Phing builds, except to update the separate parameter file (which is now a single point of entry instead of 3 separate files).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forget about waiting for releases. I do &lsquo;em as I go along. Continuously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even via good ol&rsquo; &nbsp;Live Update, we deploy continuously!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the modern way of doing it. Phing &amp; GitHub are powerful ways to make it happen for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>&nbsp;(June 26, 2012):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Nicholas:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The BleedingEdge category type was designed to remedy this issue.

There is no Tienda version for Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late last week, I finally sat down to start the conversion. First thing to convert: admin&rsquo;s &ldquo;General Configuration&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within 20 minutes of sitting down, I was digging into Joomla 2.5 itself. Within an hour, I knew I&rsquo;d be using FoF sooner than later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last night, just after 2:00am, I finished my proof-of-concept of the &ldquo;General Configuration&rdquo; admin using FoF in Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The notion of somehow &ldquo;porting&rdquo; to Joomla 2.5 is out the window.

All that talk about &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/lasallemart4\" target=\"_blank\">Moneyball</a>&rdquo; is for real. We&rsquo;re really doing it, and I love it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Framework on Framework&rdquo; (FoF) by AkeebaBackup.com was something I was going to look at for LaSalleMart at some point. Well, the future is now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interjection: Nicholas emailed me that I&rsquo;m wrong. There&rsquo;s more to the history of FoF than what I know. Here&rsquo;s his verbatim email reply he asked me to publish:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>FOF is NOT &ldquo;my own version of Nooku Framework&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;a distillation of what attracted us to the Nooku Framework in the first place&rdquo;. FOF is based on my ideas about a framework extension which predate my involvement with Nooku by two years. FOF began its life in August 2009 as a set of three base MVC classes written for my own use, with the goal of simplifying my life. Since then, these classes had made it into two custom projects for clients, as well as ARS and Admin Tools, all predating my involvement with NF. The repos are out there to prove my word. Naturally, I had to evolve this to a full blown library once I realised that NF wouldn&rsquo;t deliver. Naturally, I implemented some conventions which are common with NF as I wanted to make Akeeba Subscriptions work without NF as soon as possible. So, no, FOF is definitely not &ldquo;my own version of NF&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a different kind of fruit with a similar taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOF&rsquo;s goals are very different to those of NF. I am aiming for stability, backwards compatibility, extending (<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;replacing) Joomla! Platform and giving you something which doesn&rsquo;t get in your way when you want to override it. All of that while focusing on what matters to developers in the real world: quick turnaround and minimal code maintenance.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Why don&rsquo;t I enable comments on this blog, nor on my Media site? Because I hate moderating public forums.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I&rsquo;m contrarian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m leaving my incorrect history-of-FoF intact below, so you know what Nicholas is responding to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you, Nicholas, for taking the time to send me your email. And, thank you for making FoF available as a FOSS Joomla library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another email exchange:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>the initial&nbsp;<strong>classes</strong>&nbsp;upon which FoF&nbsp;<strong>is based</strong>&nbsp;predate&nbsp;<strong>my involvement</strong>&nbsp;with Nooku Framework by 2 years. Nooku Framework did exist as a private project at that time. When NF was first presented publicly in JaB10 (April 2010 if memory serves) I had already been working on those classes for a year and I had already written ARS based on them&nbsp;<img alt=\":)\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" style=\"float:none\" /></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less code, speed up turnaround. That&rsquo;s what I want from FoF. And that&rsquo;s what I get. On top of that, there are extra kickers that are kick-ass. But, the fundamental value of FoF is (1) LESS CODE; (2) FASTER TURNAROUND.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is, of course, the promise of the Nooku Framework. As you know, once I started programming with the NFW for my Tienda Distro, I concluded that I could not use it!&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs40\" target=\"_blank\">Here&rsquo;s my podcast announcing my un-using NFW</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicholas was coming to the same conclusion, as I mention in my podcast. Naturally, Nicholas wrote his own version of the Nooku Framework. He called it FoF. You&rsquo;ll hear me say on occassion that a pearl is created from irritation. Well, FoF is a gem, although its genesis is frustration. FoF is a distillation of what attracted us to the Nooku Framework in the first place. The number one thing that attracted us was the promise of&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;having to code 50% to 80% of the normal Joomla code for a standard normal component. FoF delivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF is just a handful of PHP files in one single solitary folder. When I first saw it, I thought I had overlooked it! I kept digging for the plugin! Oh, boy, you know, the FoF version of the &ldquo;koowa&rdquo; plugin that remained intact after I uninstalled a NFW component and crashed my site. So, naturally, I&rsquo;m searching for the FoF plugin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forget it. No plugin, no modules, no mimicking the Joomla folder structure. Whew, I assumed &ldquo;FoF&rdquo; stood for &ldquo;Files upon Folders&rdquo;. Nope. One folder, one handful of files. FoF is a wonderful distillation that delivers as promised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My &ldquo;General Configuration&rdquo; proof-of-concept is weird. There&rsquo;s a controller folder, but no files in it. Same for the model folder. I spent how long trying to find out how to create the component&rsquo;s main links at the top &mdash; studying Akeeba Subs looking for the elixer! Then, light-bulb! FoF &ldquo;just does it&rdquo; when I stick to the naming conventions. It&rsquo;s the first time I programmed something in Joomla by not doing anything. Totally my cup of tea!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicholas, thank you for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>writing FoF;</li>\r\n	<li>converting it to a Joomla library;</li>\r\n	<li>making it FOSS;</li>\r\n	<li>creating a wonderful Assembla space for FoF;</li>\r\n	<li>creating a wonderful sample component for FoF &mdash; which uses Phing!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a gem!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And an integral aspect of LaSalleMart for Joomla 2.5!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sdFLEQgJ_RA?rel=0\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdFLEQgJ_RA\" target=\"_blank\">Rapid Application Development with FoF at Joomla and Beyond 2012</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://akeeba.assembla.com/spaces/fof\" target=\"_blank\">akeeba.assembla.com/spaces/fof</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://akeeba.assembla.com/code/to-do-fof/git/nodes\" target=\"_blank\">akeeba.assembla.com/code/to-do-fof</a></p>\r\n', 'WHILE INPUTTING MY WORDPRESS POSTS TO MY LARAVEL BLOG APP (Aug 2014): Nicholas\' \"Framework on Framework\" for Joomla was the key to making Joomla software development do-able.

He enunciates the tensions involved with planning a Joomla 3.0 distro. He also articulates the tensions involved with maintaining a simple little Joomla distro versus broadening the scope into new unique features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Club Commerce, the investment in our own &ldquo;Square One&rdquo; type of Joomla Distro is worth it. But, an investment it shall be as it will take time, effort, and money to make a serious go of it.

(38, 0, NULL, NULL, 'Club Commerce-LaSalleMart vs Magento-Ebay: Keep Your Value in The Family', 'keep-your-value-in-the-family', '<p>Magento constantly comes up in conversation. This week a question posed in the Joomla User Group Toronto Facebook page referred to Magento. I responded with a detailed reply; but, I want to get across the idea here that if eBay values your contribution in their ecosystem, maybe you should realize as a user your true contribution and lever it by being in the Club Commerce-LaSalleMart family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nearly specialized in Magento, but I just didn&rsquo;t take to it. I had trouble installing the community version, I had trouble adding products, I crashed my site whenever I installed an add-on. The one consistent message I hear about Magento is &ldquo;it has a long learning curve&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t doubt it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magento is not a panacea. It requires a serious investment of time/effort to learn. Each add-on costs. Consulting costs. It all costs. Sometimes I get the impression that people perceive Magento as the best of Joomla ecommerce plus the best that Prestacart has to offer plus the best that Opencart has to offer plus the best that Ubercart has to offer. Magento is just like any other cart: it has its pros and its cons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the Magento &ldquo;Compare Editions&rdquo; page at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.magentocommerce.com/product/compare\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.magentocommerce.com/product/compare</a>?&nbsp;Prices went up considerably!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla ecommerce has tremendous potential to serve the marketplace that is not interested in paying $15,000 just to get the software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart for Joomla 2.5 will be well suited to serve this marketplace. Feature sponsorship via Club Commerce will provide the targeted, relevant features that are needed to serve this marketplace. A marketplace that I think is ready to further embrace Joomla ecommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look at Magento as part of a big corporate behemoth, and not as a small open source cart project. Why? Because Magento is 100% owned by eBay. Magento is now an important element of growing a new line of business for eBay, which, personally, lessens the attraction of Magento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pressure to grow revenue is relentless. eBay bought PayPal to secure a payment gateway for themselves. PayPal grew into a separate line of business, contributing stable income that balanced out eBay&rsquo;s earnings variability. PayPal earns revenue from non-eBay transactions, which is the source of its stable income. To grow PayPal revenue, eBay is getting into open source ecommerce. After all, this area is contributing significant earnings to PayPal. Why not become a huge purveyor of ecommerce to drive it&rsquo;s PayPal income. And, if this area can cover its costs and add to the bottom line, all the better. At least, that&rsquo;s how I see it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>eBay&rsquo;s annual and quarterly reports are at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://investor.ebayinc.com/annuals.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">http://investor.ebayinc.com/annuals.cfm</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Page 10 of the 2011 Annual Report describes X-Commerce:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In addition to our reportable segments, in 2011, we launched a business initiative of cloud-based commerce tools called X.commerce.&nbsp;X.commerce is a platform that provides software developers access to our APIs to develop functionality for merchants of all sizes. By bringing&nbsp;together the technology assets and developer communities of eBay, PayPal and Magento, an ecommerce storefront platform we acquired in&nbsp;August 2011, the X.commerce ecosystem provides tools that are designed to drive innovation for online, mobile, social and local commerce.&nbsp;Merchants can use these tools to create web storefronts, track sales and collect payments. We also have an application store called Magento&nbsp;Connect where developers can market and sell add-on functionality and solutions to merchants that use a Magento storefront.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Segmented information on page 55. Revenues associated with X.commerce, which was launched in conjunction with our acquisition of Magento in the&nbsp;third quarter of 2011, was $7.7Million. This is the first quarter of revenue for X.commerce, a LoB that is expected to contribute significant revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My question to you is: why should we contribute to a corporate behemoth&rsquo;s value by participating in their ecosystem? This is the worst private sector economy since the Dirty Thirties, so it is as incumbent upon us, the user community, to retain the value we represent for ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The money we spend on our ecommerce technology is valuable. Banding together to aggregate this spending on targeted, relevant features &mdash; utilizing continuous deployment tools and techniques &mdash; allows us to retain the value of this spending, and to lever it. Directly controlling &amp; managing our ecommerce technology we use on our sites gives us the ability to harvest extra RoI that is coveted by the corporate behemoths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll increase our income, and our wealth, faster by creating our own ecosystem instead of participating in someone else&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p>\r\n', 'WHILE INPUTTING MY WORDPRESS POSTS TO MY LARAVEL BLOG APP (Aug 2014): Corporations value your participation in their eco-systems.

I would recommend doing that in a way which allows people to comment. It&rsquo;s incredible how much useful information you can get by discussing code. A lot of FoF features owe their presence to discussions help in Joomla! conferences around the globe and discussions with the early adopters.&nbsp;From that point, once you have enough information which may be relevant for other developers, we can pull them into the main wiki at Assembla, of course giving credit where credit&rsquo;s due.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for contacting me with ideas etc, Assembla is the perfect place. It has a wiki and a ticket system, very well integrated with its merge request facility. As you&rsquo;ll see, nobody has ever sent me a patch file. It&rsquo;s all about fork it, fix it, do a merge request. A lot of discussion took place over merge requests. It&rsquo;s the most efficient method, actually! Talking about code which is right there, spotting problems, fixing them, integrating them, within minutes or hours. It&rsquo;s a very organic process. It&rsquo;s fun, even!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I know Nicholas is irritated that I do not enable commenting on my blogs. However, at his urging, for my FoF articles, I shall enable!</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Regarding commenting, it&rsquo;s one thing having public comments for a generic opinion article and a completely different thing having public comments for an article about code. The former attracts all kinds of haters and trolls and I certainly understand why you don&rsquo;t want comments. The latter, however, attracts hardcore geeks.

So, we&rsquo;ll bear with them all the way, and then we&rsquo;ll be using a live site with Bootstrap that we can reference for LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s talk about com_lmadminconfig. &nbsp;Would prefer to call it &ldquo;com_lasallemart_administration_general_configuration&rdquo;, but the shorter the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of figuring out how to convert Tienda&rsquo;s admin component to Joomla 2.5, I am busting it up into a bunch of smaller components, and basically starting from scratch where possible. Starting with the &ldquo;easiest&rdquo; chunk of the admin, the &ldquo;General Configuration&rdquo;. The admin itself is purely a means to update the database. So, using Akeeba&rsquo;s &ldquo;Framework on Framework&rdquo; should be a Big Help in writing &ldquo;BREAD&rdquo; functions (browse, read, edit, add, delete records).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My assumption about who is using LaSalleMart is different than the &nbsp;usual. I assume it&rsquo;s not a consumer. Who is using LaSalleMart? People who are integrating into software development. It&rsquo;s very important to do things in a standard way, because we-the-members-of-Club-Commerce want to get software onto our sites as fast as possible. So, displaying all the config options in a single form is not a priority. Let&rsquo;s stick to what FoF was made for, and not just bull ahead with a custom form. Config records change infrequently, and the intention is to initialize them as much as possible during installation, so editing one single record at a time is not unreasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another things is that we have to be careful not to stuff all sorts of shit into our existing components. What I am finding is that there are so many exceptions with the configuration that the exceptions are the standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that is irritating is that the configuration codes are not used in the language strings. It sure would be easier if the same code were used throughout the component, so it would be easy to recognize what goes with which. Not to mention, makes it easier to program! Why hard-code the name of the language string when we can use a variable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, bet your ass there&rsquo;s refactoring going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that I am &nbsp;doing is adding reference tables in the database. I want a standard way of using codes, which is have a small static table listing the codes. This is done with currencies already: #__lasallemart_currencies is a teeny tiny table whose records are currency codes. I don&rsquo;t want to hard code codes, and I don&rsquo;t want to use the &ldquo;enum&rdquo; field type in the tables. I want to use standard reference tables, and then use FoF so I have to do a one line call to build the drop-down field. Based on fine work already done, I wrote this ability into FoF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we at Club Commerce really want to create decent software fast, then we better give a shit about how we construct our software. The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a user so I don&rsquo;t care how you do it&rdquo; attitude doesn&rsquo;t cut it here, because this is completely anti-thetical to what we are setting out to achieve. We can&rsquo;t vertically integrate into software development and simultaneously not give a shit about developing software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about the features! The power is in the ability to create features AND bring those features to real sites. Learning and using FoF &mdash; and getting involved in that project &mdash; now instead of later &ndash;refactoring the non-standard stuff. Well, here we go!</p>\r\n', 'WHILE INPUTTING MY WORDPRESS POSTS TO MY LARAVEL BLOG APP (Aug 2014): On a small scale I had achieved my Club concept...', '', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/mid-july-lasallemart-status', 'update2.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2012-07-15', '2012-07-15 12:00:00', 1, '2012-07-15 12:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

My ears heard &ldquo;can I get a FREE look at LaSalleMart possibly give it a FREE trial?&rdquo;. My head interpreted it as &ldquo;Can I get LaSalleMart for free?&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line on a freebie version of LaSalleMart: once LaSalleMart for Joomla 2.5 is done, and once we figured out how we will intermediate Joomla (another blog post, but not today!), &nbsp;we will release a basic Joomla Distro of LaSalleMart called &ldquo;LaSalleMart Lite&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will have the basic feature set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;etre will be to&nbsp;let the public kick the LaSalleMart tires. A segment of the marketplace will be satisfied with the feature set offered, and we&rsquo;re happy to satisfy that marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, a couple of things. First, we&rsquo;re going to have to release simultaneous versions of &ldquo;LaSalleMart Lite&rdquo; &mdash; for Canada, for the rest of the world , for California (perhaps); and, for whatever jurisdiction there is a demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, there is little chance that an all encompassing all-in-one installation routine will be created for LaSalleMart. Why? Because the Joomla installer represents a technical and psychological bottleneck, that&rsquo;s why! LaSalleMart will be comprised of a lot of disparate pieces, and the intention is to create a matrix of custom Joomla Distros to put those pieces together. The &ldquo;LaSalleMart Lite&rdquo; series of Distros will be a subset of the entire matrix of Joomla Distros we will create/maintain within Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the &ldquo;LaSalleMart Lite&rdquo; Distros are locked-and-loaded, we will solicit the JED to list LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could do some work with the LaSalleMart 1.0 for Joomla 1.5 that we have, but to drive on the highway to Joomla 2.5 we need to resist the sideroads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, in the here-and-now, there is no free version of LaSalleMart for download, nor a JED listing. In due time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPDATE: I much prefer that LaSalleMart/Club Commerce stand on its own two feet, and not depend on other sites for referrals.

Don&#39;t have that perfect &quot;elevator&quot; pitch ready, that&#39;s it. Well, how about: the software I forked never went live, but mine did go live.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will have more to say on this!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>===================================================================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today in the Toronto Joomla Group&rsquo;s Facebook page, I was asked to use &ldquo;Plain English&rdquo; with my explanations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fair enough!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the gist:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is a co-operative of consultants who are vertically integrating into software development.<br />\r\nClub Commerce is NOT, repeat NOT, a typical Joomla club that sells software via site subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty effin&rsquo; expensive doing software development. Not to mention not every consultant can do some sort of coding. Plus, there&rsquo;s a massive amount of software development to do. So, to achieve vertical integration, we band together! It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vertical integration means we create/maintain the software we use for our consulting business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vertical integration does NOT, repeat NOT, mean selling our software!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are vertically integrating into software development because it is good business. Our revenues depend on technology, and we don&rsquo;t want to rely on others for that technology with which our revenues depend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $36/month to me is to offset the loss of consulting revenue by leading LaSalleMart/Club Commerce. Otherwise, pursuing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart will be a side hobby. Or, I end up developing LaSalleMart for a small coterie of monied clients and the general public will not see the LaSalleMart at all &mdash; which is Very Bad.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad because there are amazing business opportunities for us consultants (and site owners) who &ldquo;do the code&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe $83.33/month extra per Club Member pays for programmers we hire. Members pay this directly to the programmers, not me. $83.33/month x 12 months x 300 Members = $250,000 in direct programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did anyone play the trumpet like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong\" target=\"_blank\">Satchmo</a>&nbsp;before Satchmo?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, we&rsquo;re playing Joomla ecommerce, but in a completely different way than anyone has done it before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce/LaSalleMart is new, is different, and is the right fucking response to our unique fucking pressures as consultants in the worse private sector economy since the Dirty Thirties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are the live versions of LaSalleMart:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>LaSalleMart 1.0 for &nbsp;Canada for Joomla 1.5 only;</li>\r\n	<li>LaSalleMart 1.0 for California for Joomla 1.5 only;</li>\r\n	<li>LaSalleMart 1.0 &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; for Joomla 1.5 only.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is available by subscribing to my Club Commerce. The cost is $36CDN per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, LaSalleMart Canada is the only full featured Joomla cart maintained by and for Canadians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, LaSalleMart is the only full featured Joomla cart maintained in North America &mdash; which seems rather incredible. Yet, the Joomla carts are mainly European.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 1.0 is a fork of Tienda 0.8.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More precisely, LaSalleMart 1.0 is a fork of Bob Bloom&rsquo;s custom Distro for Tienda 0.8.2, which included an add-on for Canadian GST/PST/HST. This Distro was live on a handful of sites before the full fledged fork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main differences are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Akeeba Live Update;</li>\r\n	<li>cleaned up back-to-basics checkout;</li>\r\n	<li>guest checkout and one page checkout deleted;</li>\r\n	<li>custom extension footer;</li>\r\n	<li>registration form layout tweaks;</li>\r\n	<li>some Tienda rough edges smoothed out during UAT for first live site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We put in practice the theory we&rsquo;ve been espousing about software builds with tremendous success. There are three simultaneous full featured flavours of LaSalleMart; and, we can get fixes and upgrades onto your site within 10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently working on LaSalleMart for Joomla 2.5 by converting Tienda 0.8.2 to Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We assumed that we&rsquo;d do a straight conversion first. Once we had LaSalleMart for Joomla 2.5 in our hands, then we&rsquo;d start modifying it drastically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is actually happening is that we are diving into changes whilst converting. I will skip completely the why&rsquo;s and wherefore&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;extension developers,&nbsp;<em>we are consultants</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to&nbsp;<em>vertically integrate</em>&nbsp;into software development because it&nbsp;<em>makes business sense</em>&nbsp;for us.&nbsp;So, we are coming at extension development from the other side, the user side, which is highly unusual! We are blessed with some programming chops, but this is the first time we actually forked a Joomla extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we got into software development, we discovered that there are profound business opportunities from being involved in development.<em>&nbsp;If we had not &ldquo;crossed the line&rdquo;, we&rsquo;d never open our eyes to it.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These profound business opportunities are based on two things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>free uber-geeky software process tools;</li>\r\n	<li>we &nbsp;have the code,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the software development process,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the websites &ndash; a powerful edge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who are we?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are a very small group of consultants and users who comprise the Founding Members of Club Commerce. There are less than a dozen of us. Most of us live in the GTA, and are active in the JUGT, with a wonderful representative from JUGSWO. All are Canadians, except for an exceptional consultant living in Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of our tiny group of fabulous professionals, Zach Atkinson and myself are the ones doing the actual development right now. It&rsquo;s been a tremendous advantage that we are able to physically meet-up, and it is this powerful collaboration that is motiving me to urge our fellow GTA-ers to be half of the 300 Club Commerce Members &mdash; we have a heckuva opportunity here to kick major Joomla ecomm ass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of Club Commerce is to band together our peers so we can harvest these business opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cost sharing is an key component of banding together</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Canada Post just announced improvements to its web services. These require fresh coding. Peers banding together to share the costs ensures that these new features are brought to our websites fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another example: integrating QuickBooks with LaSalleMart. I guess-timate that the inital cost will be $15,000, and yearly maintenance $5,000. QuickBooks Canada is not the same thing as QuickBooks U.S. &nbsp;So, 100 of us Canadians in Club Commerce band together with $150 each to build this integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will you be able to serve your local Canadian market better because you have up-to-date Canada Post features? Because you have QuickBooks integration? We know we will!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relying on ourselves, and not relying on others, will put more features in our hands with which to grow our consulting and online businesses. Our clients will make more money, and we will have more billing opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, because Club Commerce Founding Members are mostly people associated with the Joomla User Group Toronto and Joomla User Group SouthWest Ontario, we want at least half our Club Commerce Members to be from the extended GTA area (including Niagara). Why? So we can meet in person to maximize our learning opportunities, talk about LaSalleMart&rsquo;s development one-on-one; and, to give back to JUGT and JUGSWO which have been very good for LaSalleMart. Toronto can be on the forefront of worldwide Joomla ecommerce &mdash; why not!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Bob</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'The GIST of LaSalleMart and Club Commerce...\r\n                        ', '', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/plain-english-gist', 'foss1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2012-07-18', '2012-07-18 12:00:00', 1, '2012-07-18 12:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

Then, Zach and I worked our tushes off collaborating for the first live site&rsquo;s UAT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE WHILE INPUTTING MY WORDPRESS POSTS TO MY LARAVEL BLOG APP (Aug 2014): Geez, I talk about Zach a lot, basically a kid who was involved in my software development, and then vanished, basically, in&nbsp;the middle of the night. Zach had very little to do with LaSalleMart uno, duo, and treize. Whatever he contributed, great. I give the impression that he contributed 50,000 lines of code or something. Very interesting reading all my four years of posts in one go, with the benefit of hindsight.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zach and I had met personally during the UAT to discuss the live site; and, to talk about converting to Joomla 2.5. We agreed that we would strip out a ton of stuff, convert a &ldquo;lean mean&rdquo; LaSalleMart, and then we would build up feature upon feature via Club Commerce. After all, the Club is supposed to be a feature creation machine!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, once that live site was humming, I checked on the status of the Tienda for Joomla 2.5 project, as the time to convert LaSalleMart to Joomla 2.5 had come. The status: it was a work in progress. So, &nbsp;no code to study. No problemo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the intention was to get the massive single extension reduced to a merely huge single extension, convert it to Joomla 2.5, and then, essentially, start the &ldquo;real&rdquo; LaSalleMart development. Our goal is simply to get a LaSalleMart for Joomla 2.5 to get the ball rolling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, finally, I sat down to start the conversion. It took 20 minutes to realize what a crock of shit our approach was. I asked Zach, how the hell are we supposed to know if our conversion efforts are working? Are we supposed to magically do the conversion, then install it on Joomla 2.5, and voila! Then start the debug?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our UAT work had me returning to the Tienda download page to confirm something I remember reading. Yup, there was a caveat on that download page, warning that Tienda was a &ldquo;production beta&rdquo; and, there are things that may not work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, y&rsquo;know, we were making an assumption without realizing it. We were assuming that Tienda was &ldquo;convertible&rdquo; as-is. If something doesn&rsquo;t work, then will that introduce problems while converting? Which is faster: making Tienda production-ready first in Joomla 1.5, and then converting; or, converting and hoping there are no real obstacles to conversion? Only hindsight has the answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a technical term I learned in my computer science courses: &ldquo;Fuck It!&rdquo;. That was my solution. We would go our own way right away. The point of having an intermediate step was to make things easier, so we could get our foothold in 2.5. Well, there&rsquo;s no easy intermediate step, there&rsquo;s just a bunch of hard decisions to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zach was exactly right to kick my ass to convert my custom Tienda Distro into LaSalleMart. Exactly right that I should stop marketing Club Commerce and put sweat equity into LaSalleMart. BTW, he did so in person, in a consummate professional manner &mdash; something that motivates me to reach out to my fellow GTA-ers to form the bulk of my Club Commerce Members. However, all that time I spent enumerating how Club Commerce will work, and how there&rsquo;s supra-RoI inherent in the development process, has its effect: I have a razor sharp vision of LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, we are creating LaSalleMart anyways. We are not setting out to create an idyllic version of Tienda; nor, is our objective to create a Joomla 2.5 version of Tienda. Tienda is our starting point, and a great starting point. But, LaSalleMart will eventually lose all its Tienda-ness anyways. If this starts sooner than later, then it starts sooner than later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to bust up LaSalleMart into a ton of repos &mdash; so, let&rsquo;s start that now. We&rsquo;re going to strip away all the Tienda Framework anyways, so let&rsquo;s start that now. We&rsquo;re going to remove all the cross-selling extensions, so let&rsquo;s clean it up now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re going our own way because we know the way we&rsquo;re going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I sat down and did something amazing. I took what I think is the simplest piece of the admin and<em>started from scratch</em>. And, it worked! Oh boy, did it work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what I did? I took Nicholas&rsquo; sample component for his Framework on Framework (aka &ldquo;FoF&rdquo;), and created a different General Configuration form. In a fell swoop, I completely sidestepped conversion, and I completely sidestepped all the clean-up. Hopefully, this approach will work through the admin, because, gee, after all, the admin is one big &ldquo;front end&rdquo; for the database. I have my doubts, but I&rsquo;ll cross the bridges as I get to them. The General Config involves some clean-up, but that&rsquo;s another blog post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up adding to the &ldquo;FoF&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve not made a pull request yet, but I will. To be honest, I&rsquo;m wondering if I should fork &ldquo;FoF&rdquo;, start a new LaSalleMart library, or what. Although I have an idea what to do, I&rsquo;ll be putting these ideas to Zach next week when we meet for the Toronto Joomla meet-up. Although I&rsquo;ve bugged him already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We certainly have enough material to cover already for our first Club Commerce meet-up, when local Membership grows!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something to remember, of course, is that Tienda released an alpha. Meaning it&rsquo;s released for testing. My only interest is to study the code. And my interest doing that right now is reflected in my not having downloaded it, and have no plans to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;You can go your own way!<br />\r\nGo your own way<br />\r\nYou can call it another lonely day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n', 'WHILE INPUTTING MY WORDPRESS POSTS TO MY LARAVEL BLOG APP (Aug 2014): It\'s not as if I set out to create my own ecommerce software.

Since Joomla! 3.0 the JModel / JController / JView names are used by Interfaces and the new MVC structure which has nothing to do with the old one and pretty much screws all fools who did things the Joomla! Way. The old structure is retained in the Legacy classes, e.g. JModelLegacy. Despite no plan actually existing, I suspect that the Legacy classes will be dropped. When that happens&nbsp;<strong>I will include them inside FOF</strong>. If the other Joomla! Platform classes FOF depends on are re-fuck-tored too, I will provide my own alternatives. In other words I am going to grow FOF as the Joomla! features it depends on are spirited away between Joomla! releases. This will asymptotically lead to a new framework but, as I said, backwards compatibility is king. The only real reason for me to break it is a new PHP version making it impossible to keep it.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF (FOF?!) reduces code required to write components; and, helps today&rsquo;s components work in tomorrow&rsquo;s Joomla.

Nearly all the tools &amp; sites are free &mdash; which is quite remarkable, so everyone anywhere has access to &lsquo;em &mdash; but learning &lsquo;em, setting &lsquo;em up, and running &lsquo;em is a bitch.

I run 50-ish regular CRON jobs to crank out unattended, unfailing Akeeba Backup Pro backups &mdash; backups that are so &ldquo;pro&rdquo; that I do my WordPress backups with Akeeba Backup. On the rare occassion that these CRONs fail, it is due to the transfer to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\">S3</a>. CRON Problems are clearly enunciated in the notification email. Nicholas rewards people who read, which is so ironic, with witicisms and insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I started writing my Phing files to especially build my free LaSalleMart downloads. Throughout the day I felt increasingly haunted by my experience giving away my Virtuemart add-ons way back when Virtuemart was the Hot Thing. It was an over-all crappy experience giving away software. There are a lot of people who just cannot afford, or who refuse to pay, for support. Free software became the hook for people to try to get free consulting, pure and simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In no small way, Nicholas&rsquo; leadership has played a part in my decision to release free versions of LaSalleMart. As the beneficiary of his handiwork, the best way to say &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; is follow his lead. In the same way, the decision of Dioscouri to release Tienda for Joomla 2.5 &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo;, and of course Joomla is FOSS, sways me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a marketing angle to releasing the software for free, but I&rsquo;m going to tell you something: it&rsquo;s bullshit. Of all the reasons, marketing ranks way down there. I know it in my heart, regardless of what the gurus espouse. The cost of releasing free software is massive. The time involved with the emails is unbelievable. And, you know something, my old VM add-ons had my name on it. LaSalleMart has my name all over it. So I treat my emails with great care. Well, something&rsquo;s going to give, and those emails are part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I needed a straw to break my camel&rsquo;s back, then Nicholas&rsquo; bad day today did it. What I&rsquo;ve been thinking, I am going to do with LaSalleMart 2.0 right out of the gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is the most sophisticated, most ambitious technical undertaking I&rsquo;ve done in a decade. My heavy investment in knowledge in software build infrastructure is paying off behind the scenes handsomely. With it, I am finalizing LaSalleMart 2.0 builds for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>free version of LaSalleMart for Canada;</li>\r\n	<li>free version of LaSalleMart for California;</li>\r\n	<li>free version of LaSalleMart for Florida;</li>\r\n	<li>free version of LaSalleMart for North Carolina;</li>\r\n	<li>free version of LaSalleMart &ndash; unlocalized;</li>\r\n	<li>Club version of LaSalleMart for Canada;</li>\r\n	<li>Club version of LaSalleMart for California;</li>\r\n	<li>Club version of LaSalleMart for Florida;</li>\r\n	<li>Club version of LaSalleMart for North Carolina;</li>\r\n	<li>Club version of LaSalleMart &ndash; unlocalized;</li>\r\n	<li>separate install of the LaSalleMart framework library;</li>\r\n	<li>separate install of the LaSalleMart framework&rsquo;s system library;</li>\r\n	<li>19 modules;</li>\r\n	<li>37 plugins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Nicholas&rsquo; Live Update for the extensions only, I will be able to get fixes to you in 5 minutes, down from 10 minutes for LaSalleMart 1.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effort to set this up blows me away, but whoa is it ever worth it. All these packages, but code is not replicated. The lego block theory of software builds in action. And, it represent just the appetizer of what&rsquo;s to come!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effort&rsquo;s been so all-encompassing that today I perused the Square One CMS Google Group to refresh my memory. Naturally, I zoomed in on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/square-one-cms/Eg147AL120k\" target=\"_blank\">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/square-one-cms/Eg147AL120k</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y&rsquo;know, I set up two separate websites just to figure out how to use Joomla&rsquo;s and ARS&rsquo; One-Click-Update for plugins and modules. And I can&rsquo;t get it to work. So for launch, only the components enjoy Akeeba Live Updates. I&rsquo;m certainly on the other end of the spectrum, because I will not enter a help ticket to Nicholas until I&rsquo;ve dug a little more. Then, I want to be as specific as I can be. Plus, it&rsquo;s been a long sprint and I really should have packed it in hours ago and started back at it fresh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, it didn&rsquo;t hit me until I went outside and got some fresh air that what I am doing, busting up Tienda&rsquo;s one-huge-zip file + putting each individual extension into a repo + re-building each extension with Phing + using ARS extensively, is no different than taking Joomla, re-constructing each individual component/module/plugin into repos &amp; builds and overall creating a disto. BULLS-EYE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That epiphany inspired hours of research I did not expect to do today. But it is very clear to me that busting up Tienda and busting up Joomla are pretty well the same exercise. Once I figure out the how&rsquo;s-and-wherefore&rsquo;s, I can create full Joomla Distros &mdash; exactly the vision!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve invested so much, so lavishly &mdash; and just plain gave a shit, to be frank &mdash; about the build infrastructure/process. And the payoff is so magnificent, and so extraordinary, that I will dive into my version of the Square One CMS by mid-November. The theory and the vision is actually happening, with the reality meeting or even exceeding my expectations at every turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, boy, all this wonderful-ness is causing me heartache already. The Freebie versions are not, nor will they ever be, fire-and-forget. Letting &lsquo;em loose is going to invite a heavy backlash. Oh, did I mention, I amputated Tienda&rsquo;s installation PHP in its entirety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, there is not one line of installation code in LaSalleMart. The installation is pure Joomla. A base installation requires a minimum of five individual installations in the J! installer: the extension, the library, the library&rsquo;s system plugin, the user plugin, and the system plugin. Plus, you have to manually enable each plugin. How many people will rush to install, eschew all documentation (that does not magically appear, btw, it requires a certain effort, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not out to create the next Virtuemart or Tienda or anything. Pardon me, but I&rsquo;m not looking in the rear view mirror while doing this thing. I am forking Tienda, but not with the purpose to be &ldquo;Tienda, but better than Tienda&rdquo;. LaSalleMart is diverging immediately from Tienda, and will continue to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an Inside, and there is an Outside. For those on the outside using the freebie versions, you get nothing. The freebie versions will not be updated regularly, doc is whatever the hell I provide, and there is abso-tively, posi-lutely, no support of any kind. No exceptions. You are on your own. Deal with it. If you install it and your site blows up, tough shit. Email me and be ignored &mdash; yes, to hell with it. I remember how it was, when people weren&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d respond to emails asking for help, and then my friendly advice would stimulate all manner of gambits for hard-core consulting. NFW this go &rsquo;round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My original vision of LaSalleMart is coming to fruition, which is an amazing statement to make given the late nights I&rsquo;ve confessed to myself that such a thing would never see the light of day. Well it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is why I am sticking to my original vision, which I&rsquo;ve verbosely described with great verbiage over the last two years, to perpetual complaints by those who insist on applying proper marketing. Oh well. The perseity of persistence!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicholas&rsquo; leadership inspires me to release my LaSalleMart packages for free along with decent, but limited, documentation/support. Today&rsquo;s death threat on Nicholas nixes any notions I had about delivering any &mdash; and I mean any &mdash; doc/support for my freebies. Fergitaboudit. You are either on the inside with me in my Club Commerce; or, you are on the outside looking in. And, oh, sticking with my original vision, Membership is limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPDATE: Nicholas updated his contact page.

Next comes testing the packages, taking &lsquo;em for a spin, and fixing/tweaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is a build? What is a package?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A package is the final assembly of software parts, put together by an automated process (&ldquo;build&rdquo;). LaSalleMart 2.0 for Canada is an assembly of the &ldquo;core&rdquo; and the &ldquo;canada&rdquo; software parts. My automated build process assembles it all into an integrated whole, and then puts this final software product in the different places where you can access it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never have I paid such particular attention to the &ldquo;back office&rdquo; of software development. Boy, it got more involved than I anticipated &mdash; the devil is in the details for sure &mdash; but what a payoff. Without duplicating code, we have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>5 paid flavours of the LaSalleMart extension;</li>\r\n	<li>5 free flavours of the LaSalleMart extension;</li>\r\n	<li>the LaSalleMart Library + its system plugin;</li>\r\n	<li>19 modules;</li>\r\n	<li>37 plugins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The extensions have the Akeeba Live Update built in &mdash; when there&rsquo;s an update, you just click from your admin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intention is to deliver updates and new features to you super duper fast. No waiting three months for fixes and updates to bundle together into a &ldquo;release&rdquo;. If there&rsquo;s a bug fix, you get it immediately &mdash; no waiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This speed requires an infrastructure that makes it happen. Hence, the attention to the &ldquo;back office&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge payoff with attending to the &ldquo;back office&rdquo; is creating packages. Without duplicating code, we build specific LaSalleMart packages. The extension itself has 10 packages right off the bat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s back track a minute. LaSalleMart 2.0 is a fork of Tienda for Joomla 2.5 &ldquo;alpha&rdquo;. Upon discovering this &ldquo;alpha&rdquo;, I stopped converting LaSalleMart 1.0 to Joomla 2.5; and, forked Tienda from scratch all over again. Why? Saved a ton of time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda came in one zip file. Contained within this Joomla 2.5 installable zip file was one extension, one library, almost 40 plugins, and nearly 20 modules. I busted up this zip into all its individual parts. The divergence from Tienda happened instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I busted it up, and then put it back together in different packages. This is the start of what will be a matrix of LaSalleMart packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating these packages was more intense than I thought it would be. So, I decided to finish the packages first, and then test &lsquo;em out after the fact. The packages are done, the uploads to the various server folders for your download pleasure are done, the download areas on my website are done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that my packages are done, it&rsquo;s time to test them to make sure they install ok. Along the way a few bugs were encountered, so those will be fixed as well. When all is done, the downloads will be available for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating a custom Joomla distro (ie, &ldquo;distribution&rdquo;) seemed low priority. However, &nbsp;while busting up Tienda and creating packages, it became clear &ldquo;in the doing&rdquo; that this was the same thing that I have in mind for Joomla &mdash; to take all the components, modules, and plugins that I never use out and end up with a lean mean Joomla. Basically, bust up Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of creating full Joomla distros of LaSalleMart is pretty good. But, the reality of it is even better. Busting up Tienda became a rehearsal for busting up Joomla. After I get my LaSalleMart 2.0 packages in working order, I will dive into my custom Joomla distro. Actually, I&rsquo;ve already started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 + customize Joomla + &nbsp;&ldquo;builds &amp; packages&rdquo; = stunning power for consultants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck, forget about what can be done for consultants who join me in my Club Commerce &mdash; how &rsquo;bout for me! The ability to provide &ldquo;white label&rdquo; Joomla, with the ecomm (and my favourite Joomla toys) built right in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintaining a custom Joomla means fusing the ecomm with Joomla, creating &mdash; finally! &mdash; an integrated experience. Seamless registration, integrated administration. And, geez, when we add features, we won&rsquo;t expand an impossibly busy and squished admin component. We will create fresh new small components to administer new features. Visually, you won&rsquo;t notice because the entire LaSalleMart admin is integrated into Joomla&rsquo;s admin anyways. But, it&rsquo;s very profound to build small niche components b/c it faciliates creating the matrix of LaSalleMart packages; and, it sets the stage for an explosion of development by freeing us up from merging everything into one big bad extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will go heads down on this, and update the goings-on on my November &ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast, which I will target for Friday, November 09th.</p>\r\n', 'A package is the final assembly of software parts, put together by an automated process (“build”).

Two weeks ago, we&rsquo;ve found a simple, yet effective solution to keep the modular design of Projectfork 3 by making separate components, and how to hold everything together almost seamlessly.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, really?

Each component takes care of a particular type of data: com_pfprojects is for projects, com_pfmilestones is for milestones, com_pftasks is for tasks, and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The library contains tools that are equally used and shared by all projectfork components.

Today, I want to list some lessons learned from 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Marketing: appeal to your Lizard Brain</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>My biggest lesson of 2012 is not techie. It&rsquo;s marketing, an area where I need to make my biggest strides in 2013. My conclusion: appeal to your Lizard Brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, my conversations seemed to have more subtext than in previous years. I have to ask myself, what is so different? Well, the difference is LaSalleMart 1.0 became a viable Joomla ecomm technology. The underlying ideas behind Club Commerce found an audience. The conversations became more meaningful. And, I found, the conversations were not about the things we were actually talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clients, potential clients, and just good ol&rsquo; casual chit-chat, expressed fear. A few times, I had conversations where I asked myself afterwards, &ldquo;what just happened?&rdquo;. You know what happened? The person I&rsquo;m talking about is scared, and is expressing their fear in every way except to actually say it out loud explicitly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My critical lesson learned: talk to your Lizard Brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Persist at Persisting</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>My deep dark secret about 2012 is that I grew tired of being an agent of change. It&rsquo;s tiring dealing with people&rsquo;s resistance. It&rsquo;s tiring being a lightening rod of people&rsquo;s emotional release of their insecurities about our changing world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve said &ldquo;pander&rdquo; to myself in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, boy, it would be so much easier to pander to the public &mdash; or so it seems. Instead of leading, just follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hey, isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;follow&rdquo; the ultimate catch-phrase of 2012 anyways?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every button on my screen seems to say &ldquo;follow&rdquo;, but I do not recall seeing a button that is labelled &ldquo;lead&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why don&rsquo;t I just try to exploit every trend, every hashtag, every hot controversy as a way to sell my wares? Everyone else is fomenting and exploiting ephemeral trends to sell their stuff, so it must work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not just pander to the &ldquo;follow&rdquo; culture?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren\" target=\"_blank\">siren song</a>.&nbsp;<em>Pandering to the &ldquo;follow&rdquo; culture is seduction into destruction, because leadership is the necessary response to a changing technological world</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the temptations, I persisted with LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and with the idea of creating a Joomla distro. At times it was such a grind to persist, that I had to persist and persisting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Money is in the&nbsp;ABILITY&nbsp;to Create Software</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked my ass in off in 2012 to user test LaSalleMart 1.0 for Joomla 1.5 &mdash; what a beautiful piece of work it was. Then I watched it obsolete instantly before my eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a profound experience turning a massive investment of sweat equity into zero dollars cash. I had lived&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dead-frog.com/comedians/comic/steve_martin\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;How I turned a million dollars of real estate into $25 cash</a>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living this stale dated software experience really nailed it for me that software code itself is a wasting asset. It&rsquo;s shelf life is so compressed that it&rsquo;s practically a wasted asset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps this is a natural progression of free open source software, that such software should encapsulate ephermal value to its users. Free can now be interpreted as value-free &mdash; as in value-less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value of the software is the stuff you can&rsquo;t see that brings it to fruition: the software repositories, the build processes, the methodologies employed. That is, the software development process itself is where the money is. &nbsp;Having code in your hands is not valuable anymore. Having the dev process by the balls is where the money is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of my effort to fork Tienda into LaSalleMart is focused on the behind-the-scenes dev process. I lavished time in 2012 journeying into the different methodologies and code-creation sites out there. It was the right investment to make, and in 2013 the payoff will be enormous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because the money is in the code creation, not in the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Communication Matters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>2012 reinforced my belief that &ldquo;silence is the worst response&rdquo;. LaSalleMart&rsquo;s development was not all fun and frolic, there were bumps in the road, there were frustrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one thing I got right was creating my monthly &ldquo;LaSalleMart&rdquo; News podcast, and persisting at it every month &ldquo;rain or shine&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe me, it was oh-so-tempting to go silent when things were not going to plan. But then how would you know what was happening?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when you don&rsquo;t listen to my podcasts, or even glance at my transcripts, at least you know that I am here persisting at persisting. Which is probably what you really want to know. Yes, I am here!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, I plan on stepping up communications. Videos, hangouts, podcasts &mdash; and getting out there in person in the Toronto area in two ways: through the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://toronto.joomla.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto Joomla Group</a>; and, by hosting my own Club Commerce seminars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2011 Lessons Still Apply</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially the lessons of GPL software &mdash; what the software licence is all about, and how that affects us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2013 is shaping up to be a fabulous year for LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and LaSalleCMS. Hope to see you on the inside of this success!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Bob Bloom</p>\r\n', 'Today is New Year’s Day 2013. Happy New Year!\r\nA year ago I recounted “Lessons Learned from 2011“.

And being asked all the time, and seeing the constant references to WordPress in the Joomla-verse is attributable to the fact that WordPress was in the midst of parabolic market growth. Starting in 2012, WordPress ascended to 60% of known CMS. Joomla, once the #1 CMS, was now in a parabolic market share the other way, now at 8%. Of all websites, WordPress now has 23% market share and Joomla is at 3.0% (on the way to piercing that level to 2.99% which seems inevitable). I won&#39;t give the site yet another link, but see w3techs dot com. So, no, Joomla never &quot;snapped out of it&quot;.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight, apropos, the WordPress theme du jour was directed at me about doing ecommerce in WordPress. Inside, that set me off big time. Outwardly, I was just mild mannered Joomla ecommerce guy. So, naturally, all the inward stuff channeled unfiltered to my blog post. Oh boy, to just click publish &mdash; on my WordPress blog! Ha!! Oh, dear reader, I&rsquo;ve learned long ago to write first, publish later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, something very interesting happened on the way to my upgrading two very active WordPress sites to WP3.5. The &ldquo;Know Your Rights&rdquo; page that displays after successfully upgrading. This page is sitting at&nbsp;/wp-admin/freedoms.php.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What took me by surprise was the prominence of this message. Not squirreled away in some footer tag, this was slap in your face (must be on my mind) stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My answer to many queries posed was &ldquo;use your power&rdquo;. The power vested in you by the General Public License. Here&rsquo;s what WordPress is telling you:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>WordPress is Free and open source software, built by a distributed community of mostly volunteer developers from around the world. WordPress comes with some awesome, worldview-changing rights courtesy of its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/license/\">license</a>, the GPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>You have the freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>\r\n	<li>You have access to the source code, the freedom to study how the program works, and the freedom to change it to make it do what you wish.</li>\r\n	<li>You have the freedom to redistribute copies of the original program so you can help your neighbor.</li>\r\n	<li>You have the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t you wish all software came with these freedoms? So do we! For more information, check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/\">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Substitute the word &ldquo;power&rdquo; for &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have the POWER to run the program for any purpose; you have access to the source code, the POWER to study it, and the POWER to CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT DO WHAT YOU WISH; you have the POWER to distribute copies of your MODIFIED version to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s ass how skilled you are, it does not matter. YOU HAVE THE POWER. USE YOUR FRIGGIN&rsquo; POWER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress is shoving it in your face, first thing you see when you upgrade. Are you listening. Luke, USE YOUR FRIGGIN&rsquo; POWER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla is GPL. Same deal. USE YOUR FRIGGIN&rsquo; POWER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study the code,&nbsp;<em>simply because you can</em>. It&rsquo;s an act of freedom and power. Using your power is enormously valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that getting an interpretation of the code is not as valuable as understanding the code. So valuable that any understanding of the code is a plus, regardless of how deep your knowledge goes. In Star Wars, Alec Guiness&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/quotes\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It&rsquo;s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>With open source, the code is what gives us our power. Don&rsquo;t settle for peoples&rsquo; interpretations of what the code does. Look at the source code directly. Joomla&rsquo;s source code represents millions of dollars &mdash; look at it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database is open source too. Look at it. Some tables are actually intuitively named! Don&rsquo;t worry about it being your first time launching PhpMyAdmin &mdash; just launch and look. The second time you look, it makes more sense. In fact, by the 50th time, even the field names will become familiar to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a previous life I worked in corporate I.T. I&rsquo;d have to genuflect and beg and offer burnt sacrifices for the opportunity to be refused to see the database scripts. On one project, I was the very first business analyst to ever be granted a workstation licence for the Oracle database &mdash; the first chunks of the castle wall to fall around the DBA guys. They did it to get me off their ass &rsquo;cause I was on &lsquo;em constantly for my project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the GPL, it&rsquo;s all there. So take a look. You will be amazed what your eye can pick up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was asked what Joomla ecommerce extension I thought was best. What I said, and what I thought, were of two different worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I said was: &ldquo;I am biased. You realize I am an extension purveyor&rdquo; &mdash; or something like that. &nbsp;I referred to the great overview video at the JoomlaDay 2012 by Deb Cinkus:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3CkgH6ahE8g?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I was thinking was, &ldquo;Oh gee, here we go again, the consumer&rsquo;s guide to building an online business&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just don&rsquo;t look at things like I used to. It&rsquo;s been a long grind with Joomla freelancing. Mere days before the JUGT event, I ironed out the last of my LaSalleMart 2.0 builds/downloads. It&rsquo;s been a tough grinding slog. Plus, I&rsquo;m going where the ball is being thrown, not expecting to do an inside curl and thinking the ball will be where my feet are planted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_1431.jpg\"><img alt=\"Joomla Toronto in January\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_1431-224x300.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power goes to the code creaters. Create, do not consume, software. That&rsquo;s where the value is. So use the power vested in you by the GPL. Have a way in which you can modify/fork OSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, always know what you need today and what you&rsquo;ll need tomorrow. Choose the best tool for the job. Even better, create the tools yourself! Or, at least have the ability to customize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward to our next such event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'It continues to amaze and astound me the fetish Joomla has for WordPress...', 'It continues to amaze and astound me the fetish Joomla has for WordPress...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/january-2013-joomla-toronto-ask-the-expert', 'IMG_1432.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2013-01-15', '2013-01-15 15:00:00', 1, '2013-01-15 15:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),
(65, 0, NULL, NULL, 'Mid January Update: Single-Launch Packages, First Sites and Testing, Atlassian, Pricing Changes', 'single-launch-packages-and-more-during-january-2013', '<h1>Integrated Single-Launch Joomla &ndash; LaSalleMart Packages (Distros) a Reality</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>From the get-go, I wanted to create single launch integrated Joomla-LaSalleMart packages. Packages that are updated in real-time as the underlying codebase changes. No waiting around for crucial bug fixes to be bundled with other features. I want those bug fixes on your site immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, getting those bug fixes and form tweaks and other creature features into my single launch packages is a challenge. Back in the day, Virtuemart threw a single launch package on its site. It really was terrific. But, it was never updated. It was a one-off that sat on the site as updates were released, and people downloaded it mistakenly thinking it had the latest releases in it. Nope. The Distros on my LaSalleMart.com site are updated with the latest bug fixes, form tweaks, and whatever else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you know, LaSalleMart 2.0 is a fork of Tienda&rsquo;s first Joomla 2.5 iteration. A fork is independent development of software in a different direction than pursued by its original authors. Joomla&rsquo;s license is the General Public License, which encourages forking. Well, &nbsp;the first thing I did was bust up the huge installable zip into its individual parts. The LaSalleMart component, library, modules and plugins reside in their own separate software repository, and have their own separate build files. Each individual piece now has its own separate installable zip file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My purpose is to create lego blocks of code that I put together in different ways. Now I am able to pick-and-choose what lego blocks I want in my single launch packages. I have six single launch packages &mdash; California, Canada, Florida, North Carolina, and Standard. Each package includes the necessary component, library, and plugins; and, also has the Offline Payments plugin, the Standard Shipping plugin; and, the cart module. The basics!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My single launch packages are automatically uploaded to my LaSalleMart.com site when they are built, so the packages available are always the most up-to-date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the Distros are a reality, their configurations will become more encompassing to make your set-up that much easier; and, the there will be a matrix of distros. For example, a Joomla-LaSalleMart all-in-one package for Canadians for downloadable products only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>LaSalleCMS: A Needed Joomla Distro</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I have no intention of forking Joomla. What I do intend to do is tweak Joomla to integrate better with LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My complaint is that LaSalleMart feels like the add-on that it is. What I want, what I&rsquo;ve always wanted, is LaSalleMart being an integrated part of Joomla. The entire Joomla-LaSalleMart experience needs to be seamless. Now that my single-launch packages exist, I can take a deeper look at Joomla for integration opportunities. What can be done with the admin menu? What can &mdash; and should be &mdash; done with the user handling? Are there rarely used parts of Joomla that we can safely excise? What extensions would we prefer to add to Joomla as permanent parts of Joomla?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, this is all on the up-and-up, because Joomla is released under the General Public Licence. We want to keep Joomla in all its glory, but there is some custom renovations we want to do too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I created the LaSalleCMS project. LaSalleCMS is a public open source project. Atlassian.com has granted LaSalleCMS an open source license, so JIRA, BitBucket, Confluence, and all the Atlassian on-demand goodies are provided at no cost. There is not much at the site to see &mdash; yet. But the site is at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lasallecms.atlassian.net/wiki/\" target=\"_blank\">https://lasallecms.atlassian.net/wiki/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is starting slow, which is understanding considering the focus on LaSalleMart and on the single-launch packages. However, LaSalleCMS is hardly ignored, as it is ready for where-ever our journey will take it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, LaSalleCMS is exactly Joomla 2.5.8. I&rsquo;ve done nothing more than set up the repository, the builds, and the website with the Akeeba Release System &mdash; not exactly trivial exercises. So, LaSalleCMS updates via the Joomla remote servers. What is coming is updates coming from LaSalleCMS, not Joomla. I will detail this more when I change the update source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Akeeba Release System and Joomla Updater</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of this month, I will return to figuring out the Akeeba Release System and the Joomla Updater. I am sure that the reason I can&rsquo;t make &lsquo;em work together is my own lack of getting &lsquo;em to work together. Beyond this is the new ARS&rsquo;s API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be more precise, ARS already works with the LaSalleMart components. I completely ignore the Joomla Updater, because there&rsquo;s a nice version reporting mechanism within the components. However, modules, plugins, and libraries need to use the Joomla Updater. So, the Joomla Updater needs to work with ARS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using ARS means I can offer individual updates to paid subscribers only. As well, with ARS, I can offer software for download on the same site where remote update requests are managed. Furthermore, I can do one deployment to my ARS site automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, inexorably, LaSalleMart&rsquo;s individual plugins, modules, and library will have their own updates in the Joomla Updater. The Joomla Updater will point to my LaSalleMart&rsquo;s ARS set-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way, LaSalleCMS will also use ARS the same way. For example, if I take com_banners out of LaSalleCMS, I will put it into my LaSalleCMS&rsquo; ARS set-up so you can install it individually &mdash; and so it will update via the Joomla Updater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mention this because these changes are coming &mdash; slowly perhaps, but inexorably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Pricing has Changed</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that there are no free Live Updates anymore. It is still free to download LaSalleMart Standard for Everyone. However, to use Live Update you need to buy a subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason I&rsquo;ve done this is I need you to support LaSalleMart. By support, I mean pay money into LaSalleMart. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve priced LaSalleMart subscriptions at a donation price point: $5.65CDN per month. Not only does your subscription make a difference, but I want you to subscribe. You know why? Because it costs money to hire programmers. It costs money to hire QA techs. That&rsquo;s where LaSalleMart (and LaSalleCMS too) is going: hiring skilled people. I am not relying on the kindness of strangers to provide the technical muscle powering LaSalleMart (and LaSalleCMS). Been there, done that, and if it worked for me I&rsquo;d not have decided to fork an ecomm extension but instead would be contributing to a FOSS ecomm project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve stated elsewhere, as the feature set broadens, those features will be available to paid subscribers only. I will keep the cost down, but you have to have skin in this game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Live Sites and Testing</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to my initial band of supporters. there are about a half-dozen real LaSalleMart 2.0 sites being built. These sites are serving as the initial user test sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are running into issues, as expected. Where functionaity is impaired, effort is exerted to restore it. Cosmetics, refactoring, pretty-fying &mdash; these things we need to defer. First things first!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my second fork of Tienda. The first was the Joomla 1.5 edition that became LaSalleMart 1.0. The testing and fixing up is very similar to what went on with LM1.0. It&rsquo;s all part-and-parcel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By month-end I&rsquo;ll have checkout tweaked and few rough more rough edges smoothed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, you should take a good look at LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>LaSalleMart 2.0 Listing on the Joomla Extension Directory</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>At or around month-end, I will seek listing on the JED. In preparation, I&rsquo;ve read the<a href=\"http://extensions.joomla.org/tos\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;requirements on the JED website</a>. There are extra requirements for extensions that are forks of other extensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extensions that are forks of other extensions must have features beyond the original. Such extensions must have attribution in the manifest file. While I created the distro builds, I also added this attribution. I have no idea if my handiwork will be construed as &ldquo;features beyond the original&rdquo;. Another requirement is that a fork must go down a different path of development than the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer, I blogged, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2012/why-lasallemart-is-not-available-for-free-download\" target=\"_blank\">Free LaSalleMart and JED Listing</a>&ldquo;; and, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2012/tienda-alpha-joomla-25-lasallemart-going-its-own-way\" target=\"_blank\">Tienda Alpha for Joomla 2.5: LaSalleMart is Going Its Own Way</a>&ldquo;. Well, there is now here. I am about to list LM2 on the JED, and with the package distros on LaSalleMart.com (and the existence of LaSalleCMS) you can see the shape of things to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Upcoming Features</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>With the underlying infrastructure taking shape, focus can turn to feature development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is still the aforementioned J!Updater and ARS work to do. There is already a nice little LaSalleCMS to-do list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is my attitude about feature development: it&rsquo;s a non-stop, never-ending, continuous way-of-life. It just &ldquo;is&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of how features are developed elsewhere, feature development here is not a big grand exercise into the wild blue yonder. Feature development is starting small, being small, keeping it small, and doing it continuously. There is no end-point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feature development is not an incursion into stable software, disturbing the world order, and introducing earthquakes of change. Hello! Read my blog, listen to my podcasts. WE LIVE IN A CONTINUOUS WORLD!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feature development is a way of life. We set up projects, and we do projects. Projects turn into software builds which make their way onto our sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Times are changing, software infrastructure is changing &mdash; for the better. Not to mention I&rsquo;m sick-and-tired of being sick-and-tired waiting and waiting for software releases.

It&rsquo;s not the first time I forgot to take pictures at a JUGT. Excellent to meet Allison and Sheldon. Good to put a face to Facebook!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As happens, the turnout was modest, but it gives us the opportunity to get to know each other and have deeper discussions. For the first time, we played pool (across the road) which was a nice break &mdash; certainly for me, deep into debugging this week. A good mental break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yesterday was &ldquo;Consultants talking about their client engagements&rdquo;. It was very interesting and intriguing. Just about every extension mentioned I had &ldquo;done something&rdquo; with it over the years. I was complimented on how casual I was in mentioning this-or-that with obvious knowledge. Well, nothing casual in wrestling with the code to customize it &mdash; lots of pain!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mentioned that I did not like the installation procedure for a small little plugin available for free by a well know Joomla template club. &nbsp;So, I built my own Joomla installable zip. My consulting peers thought that was great &mdash; thank you! But, I have to tell you, I did not program anything in doing it, since it was an exercise in excluding extraneous code. It&rsquo;s not very mysterious &mdash; the only &ldquo;trick&rdquo; involved is understanding the installation xml, (sometimes called &ldquo;manifest.xml&rdquo;), which is not even PHP. It&rsquo;s a Joomla specific thing, every single installable plugin, module, component, and library has one. Handy to understand!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical ecommerce scenario was posed. Up front, it was clearly stated that this was a super duper easy breezy Joomla ecomm site to set up. I like easy! I always start my questioning from the end of the checkout &mdash; what is your payment method, what are your shipping rules, etc. There were a number of modifications that came up. Also, there were different ways of accomplishing the objectives. Not as easy as advertised, but very normal when digging into the real requirements. Because I&rsquo;m all-in with the coding, including having a Joomla distro ready-to-go, all solution scenarios are possible!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very interesting question was posed: how do you know what the good extensions are? My answer is, of course, you always have to go through the code. This is the starting point. This is the glory of open source &mdash; that the source code is there for you, and that you can do anything to it to use the code as you require for your use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Free&rdquo; in &ldquo;Free Open Source Software&rdquo; = freedom! (you thought it meant &ldquo;no money&rdquo;!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Michael Douglas said in &ldquo;The American President&rdquo;, &ldquo;America isn&rsquo;t easy. America is Advanced Citizenship. You&rsquo;ve got to want it bad&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open source is software freedom. But you have to want it bad. You have to exercise your freedom to benefit from it, and to make that freedom work in the real world. In fact, if we do not exercise our software freedom rights (that are enumerated in the GPL), then the software creators have, in essence, proprietary software. And, many sneak in things that impair exercising our software freedom with their code. If we do not reject their code, then we are in fact acquiescing to impairing our freedom. It&rsquo;s not easy, software freedom. It means you have to Get In The Code!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/mWRVbWMvi7c?rel=0\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want it bad! I want my software freedom. So much so, I forked a huge full featured ecomm extension, and set up LaSalleCMS, my Joomla distro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I keep harping on this, because it keeps coming up. Get in the code!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was asked about Google Analytics and traversing the checkout. My perspective is so different, having revamped the cart.&nbsp;<em>We have the code</em>! Why be reactive? Why have a lag between fetching the stats and the customer who is long gone? Customer service is a huge difference in conversion. Why not &ldquo;do something&rdquo; in the code that is pro-active with cart abandonment, that redirects buyers to calls to action, so their sale is ultimately consummated? Can you imagine the RoI of this code!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m a rebel with a cause!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward to our next &ldquo;Ask The Expert&rdquo;&hellip;</p>\r\n', 'I thoroughly enjoyed yesterday’s Joomla User Group Toronto meet-up.

Now that I see the light at the end of this tunnel, time to come up for some air to let you know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you already know, LaSalleMart 2.0 is a fork of the first Joomla 2.5 &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; version of Tienda. At the time of this writing, February 21, 2013, this is the only version of Tienda released for Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something I&rsquo;ve always wanted is a matrix of Joomla ecommerce packages customized for geographical locations and industries &mdash; or, for whatever needs that come up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something else I want is super duper fast deployment to address my perpetual frustration waiting for releases of other OSS. LaSalleMart code should get from the kitchen to the plate while the code is still hot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve multiple live packages delivered hot, I busted up the installable zip of one component, on library, 20 modules, and 40 plugins &mdash; give or take. As LaSalleMart, each has its own software repository, its own build scripts, its own installable zip. Each is separate software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 installation is unique: the component&rsquo;s installable zip contains just the component. The plugins and library necessary to run LM2 are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;included! These are installed separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full Joomla-LaSalleMart &ldquo;distros&rdquo; will ease the pain of installing each piece separately &mdash; unfortunately, these &ldquo;distros&rdquo; are not quite ready after much testing so I am not distributing them right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s going to be some type of solution to the installation. At this stage, it is critical to have the &ldquo;lego blocks&rdquo; done. Oh, they are done &mdash; a huge effort has gone into the builds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It proved to be a very irritating experience, but it now works: my LaSalleMart 2.0 plugins, modules, and library are update-able via the Joomla Updater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The components update via the Akeeba Live Update, but only the component is update-able in this way. How do you update the other stuff without downloading from my site, and installing via the Joomla installer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, there was a ton of installation code in the software inherited. It&rsquo;s purpose was, in part, to support the installation of a suite of extensions. I deleted the whole thing completely. There is absolutely no installation software in LaSalleMart, except for minimal code in the update scripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is going to be a lot of updates to LaSalleMart 2.0, by design. You will get them on your site fast, by design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My frustration waiting for releases has manifested in my unique ground-up approach to getting LaSalleMart updates to you fast. I thought it could be done, it can be done, I did it! Making it happen took a significant amount of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; version that was forked is definitely a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo;. A lot of effort was needed just to get it in functional form. A lot less functionality was covered than desired, for two reasons: the &ldquo;builds&rdquo; were a material investment in time and effort; and, geez, this really was truly &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; software!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The priority became: get the update delivery mechanisms in place first, worry about the actual software second. Since work on LaSalleMart will be ongoing, let&rsquo;s get the code pipeline in place first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, a checkout with offline payments, PayPal Standard, and Standard Shipping, is the goal of LM2&prime;s &ldquo;JED Release&rdquo;. Standard Shipping needed major work. And, well, as I said in my recent &ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast (oh,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2013/lasallemart14\" target=\"_blank\">here&rsquo;s the link!</a>), I can&rsquo;t stand the inherited checkout.&nbsp;So I worked on checkout, and am now very close to wrapping up my upgrades to checkout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s coming down to &ldquo;The Last Spike&rdquo;!</p>\r\n', 'LaSalleMart 2.0′s application to the Joomla Extensions Directory is imminent.

I&rsquo;m not sure I like the way it is implemented, but the concept is: &ldquo;if a coupon is applicable, apply it regardless of your buyer entering it into the coupon form&rdquo;.

This is similar to what Assembla offers, which I had a great interest in. After using Assembla (and GitHub), and after being treated to a personal one-on-one webinar by &ldquo;Know where the bodies are buried&rdquo; Deb Cinkus (thank you, again, Deb), I decided to use Atlassian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hour long presentation was well done. Using their own experience with JIRA et al, they told a story. There were no technical difficulties, the usual pixel diffusion from an overhead was offset by tv screens along the breadth of the room p<br />\r\nIt is noteworthy that Atlassian stressed that its software dev products are collaborative. I expected to hear the wordlugged into the presentation. Videos of head office personages along with on-scene clips of everyday office life gave a sense of the company behind the presentation. JIRA itself is a decade old, its sister products more recent.

Nope. People may or may not be &ldquo;co-located&rdquo;, but the software process itself is collaborative. Collaborative meaning that thou shalt work together! Moving JIRA from SVN to Git, and bring QA into the software development process as (my phrase) &ldquo;Total Quality Management&rdquo; instead of as a separate function, spurred Atlassian into a collaborative culture &mdash; and its offerings as a mechanism for collaboration as software development. In the spirit of &ldquo;The Medium is the Message&rdquo;, the Process is the Software &mdash; boy, I really need to do a post about this. The end result for the JIRA team is releasing a new build to its clients bi-weekly. Relevant, quality software released often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two things I found very interesting. First was having post-its and hand-written pieces of paper plastere</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other thing that I found intriguing was the confession that design gets-in-the-way. So, to solve it, Atlassian &ldquo;put people in a room for three weeks&rdquo; (with a stack of post-its, I&rsquo;m sure), and the dev teams &ldquo;signed the contracts&rdquo; to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/design/\" target=\"_blank\">Atlassian Design Guidelines</a>. Here&rsquo;s something to bring into LaSalleMart &mdash; I&rsquo;ll be looking at this. Very interesting.d around the office. Perhaps to Digital Hipsters, paper is the new retro. But, an interesting lesson about co-locationl and, to get people to actually work together, ya gotta get &lsquo;em the heck away from the screens! White board (remember those?) and card-sized pieces of paper. And I thought eye-to-eye contact when talking to people was so Last Century!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I next log into my Atlassian on-demand instance, I will have a better idea of what I&rsquo;m using.

You install it with your eyes open. 3.1+ represents a meld of STS + LTS. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;stable&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s change-able. Your template works with 3.10, but breaks with 3.12 &mdash; &ldquo;TBSS&rdquo; (too bad, so sad, don&rsquo;t cry for me Argentina).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, my bottom line straight answer to the question, &nbsp;&ldquo;Should I use Joomla 3.1+&rdquo;, is: &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LaSalleMart 2 and Joomla 3:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase here: will LM2 work in J!3? As is, no. But, no does not mean no, you know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful trick that I&rsquo;ve used over the years: multiple websites, one database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;db_host&rdquo; is the same, &ldquo;db_password&rdquo; is the same, and each site uses its own &ldquo;db_name&rdquo;. So we have two Joomla sites: one the v3 site, and the other the v2.5 site. Both use the same database. So, in the code, we can use whatever table we want. Of course, we might have to hard code the db prefix for the second site, but a small price to pay. Perhaps make the second site&rsquo;s db prefix a new config parameter, eh! Hmmm&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three areas of LaSalleMart:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>front-end;</li>\r\n	<li>cart;</li>\r\n	<li>administrator.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Use K2 or similar for the front-end. Bam. There&rsquo;s your Joomla 3 site for your products and categories. I advocate using Joomla or K2 type extension for your front-end anyways, in order to harness the full power of Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cart needs to be in the public facing (non-administrator) part of Joomla. The cart on its own is a great candidate for porting to Joomla 3, as is the address management. But, that&rsquo;s for later. In the here and now, you need to have the cart in a Joomla 2.5 site. So, you set up your J!2.5 site in a separate child folder /store/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The admin is Joomla 2.5. Does it matter that this is in J!2.5?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, LaSalleMart is in the Joomla 2.5 site. With some modification, the LM2 &ldquo;Content&rdquo; plugin (puts the add-to-cart form on Joomla pages, and any extension that renders content plugins) and the LM2 &ldquo;Cart&rdquo; module will work in J!3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep the cart area incredibly clean. Go easy on the modules. Keep the same header and footer. Most templates have J!2.5 and J!3 versions, so the look-and-feel will be similar. It&rsquo;ll be somewhat easy to set up the J!2.5 site b/c it&rsquo;s front-end is less intensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any synchronizing between the two websites&rsquo; databases will be do-able b/c they share the same database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s do-able. The effort is tiny compared to converting LM2 to Joomla 3.1+.</p>\r\n', 'To Joomla 3 or not to Joomla 3, that is the question.

The auto-update should be able to work with a monolithic collection of extensions (that&rsquo;s really what our Joomla distro is) or individually installed extensions. In other works [sic], auto-updating should work today (theoretically) regardless of whether, for example, &ldquo;Banners&rdquo; came with distro or was installed later from someones &ldquo;playlist&rdquo; off the JED.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla is a monolithic collection of extensions, libraries, templates.

Well, I could not figure out how to get my app to use CMandrill. So, I created a library, which is what I really wanted to do in the first place! It is based on CMandrill, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My lib_mandrill is a library, but there are two parameters that it takes from LaSalleMart&rsquo;s config. Libraries do not have a door in Joomla&rsquo;s Administrator, so if there are any parameters, one has to create a plugin or a component. Since I want lib_mandrill to work with LaSalleMart, it seems natural to add the new library settings to LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:rgb(244, 244, 244); border:1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); padding:5px 0px 0px 1px\"><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/lasallemart_mandrill_config1.png\"><img alt=\"Mandrill Library Settings in LM\'s Config\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/lasallemart_mandrill_config1-300x73.png\" style=\"height:73px; width:300px\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandrill Library Settings in LM&rsquo;s Config</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a special status in LM&rsquo;s Dashboard.

The solution is to put the ecommerce front-end in a separate Joomla 3 site in the webroot; and, install a Joomla 2.5 site in a sub-folder off the webroot for the cart and LM admin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason to push for Joomla 3.1 is primarily for the mobile capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The separation of LaSalleMart into &ldquo;front&rdquo;, &ldquo;cart&rdquo;, and &ldquo;admin&rdquo; is natural. The &ldquo;front&rdquo; comprises what is usually the category and product pages. A reason to use Joomla for ecommerce is for its powerful &ldquo;front&rdquo; &mdash; the menus, the templating, the modules, the third party extensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no way that LaSalleMart can, or should, be so chock full of front-end capabilities anyways. A lot of what we see in LM&rsquo;s config is related to its front-end presentation. Hey, just remember that for product presentation, you have the full power of Joomla at your disposal &mdash; which is a prime reason for using Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing how this solution works out practically, I set up the third LaSalleMart site in just this way. Technically, it is do-able. Practically, I think the effort to achieve the technical pieces are not worth it at this point. The concerns are the integrations needed. There are actually minimal technical integrations required to achieve this dual site set-up &mdash; this is actually do-able right now. However, building a kick-ass customer experience requires achieving beyond the minimum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, no integration is required, except to link from the J!3.1 product pages to the corresponding J!2.5 LaSalleMart product pages. Users have no reason to register on the J!3.1 site &mdash; big PITA side-stepped. What we end up with are two separate and distinct sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big plus is that templates are built for both J!3.1 and J!2.5. So creating a uniform look is do-able.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your customers want a seamless experience, regardless of the number of sites they need to traverse. So, there must be just one single add-to-cart button &mdash; which is in the J!3.1 site. There must be a cart module on the J!3.1 site as well as the J!2.5 site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a common database, and having the J!2.5 site in a subfolder off the root, we have a good basis for the integration. The fun is in the details, and diving headlong into the technical issues would take more time than its worth. The issues seem similar to the web app I started, where one site calls the web app where LaSalleMart is installed. I foresee having to create a CLI app that grabs the data and layout for mod_app. The add-to-cart would be fun, having to add to a cart that resides on a separate (yet accessible) site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we ever need to create this set-up, we know it&rsquo;s do-able. By, essentially, keeping the sites separate and distinct, yet related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do wonder, though, if we can yank J!3.1&prime;s /media/jui/ and plunk it into J!2.5. We already have Akeeba&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strapper&rdquo; if we need it as a way to get Bootstrap onto our J!2.5 site. Maybe transplanting JUI is another way &mdash; it looks like a library like any other library. If the essential issue is using Bootstrap for uber-responsive sites, then we probably don&rsquo;t have to jump to Joomla 3.1 yet. Just bolster J!2.5. &nbsp;Something to keep in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE (May 27, 2013):</strong>&nbsp;Yes, definitely can yank JUI from 3.1 to 2.5. Gantry does it &mdash; see the&nbsp;libraries/gantry/assets/jui/ folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla 3.1 is a short-term release. I confess a touch of apprehension building a J!3.1 site knowing that it can change, with the risk that this change is unknown so who knows how these changes would impact my front-end site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, do not get the wrong idea. I want to transition to Joomla 3.x, en route to J!3.5 &mdash; the Long Term Release. To this end, my new programming uses the Akeeba Framework-on-Framework (version 2), which intermediates between my component and Joomla. So I can program once, and my component will work on both J!3.1 and J!2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am in the midst of creating four &mdash; count &lsquo;em! &mdash; new components. I&rsquo;ll talk more about this on my blog, or in my next podcast. So far, it is working that FoF is letting me create one component for both Joomlas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want all my new LM work to be ready for Joomla 3, so using FoF is critical. When I modify the source code I frequently end up in Joomla&rsquo;s doc, to see if this code will likely work in J!3.1, or what tweaks are needed. It&rsquo;s a fine line between tweaking for J!3.1; and, screwing up existing code. The same decision when I originally forked into LaSalleMart: do I amputate code to ahieve a lean-and-mean codebase; or, do I defer in case I break something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this forward work on Joomla 3 has been putting me on the wrong side of midnight. The learning is good, pushing the technology is good. But, some core work&rsquo;s been put on hold as a result. Now that we&rsquo;ve peered into the future, it&rsquo;s time to spend my midnight hour back on more core issues &mdash; and on my webapp(s).</p>\r\n', 'LaSalleMart 2 is not made for Joomla 3.1.

It is now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concepts underlying LaSalleMart&rsquo;s development are coming into play this month, manifesting directly into the code and into daily development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, there is a vision with LaSalleMart. What makes this month of May 2013 different from other months is the extent to which this vision is tangible-i-fying into real development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An underlying concept is: Get Small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Get Small&rdquo; means no more huge monolithic components. LaSalleMart inherited a monolithic monstrosity of an admin. An impenetrable mass of code. &nbsp;The file that was forked had about 60 plugins/modules/library/component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all LaSalleMart. That&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s about. LaSalleMart is not conceived to be a hyper-consumer-friendly Joomla extension to install and configure. It&rsquo;s not fire-and-forget software. LaSalleMart is conceived to be hyper-code-creation friendly, unlocking the vast potential of using Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Get Small&rdquo; means fast turnaround, quick fixes, and near instant transmission of updates to live sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Get Small&rdquo; means lots of separate components that stick to narrow purposes. As opposed to a huge component that does everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve explained it, somewhat in jest, as having the power of Magento, the flexibility of Joomla, the programmable power of Drupal, and the ease-of-use of WordPress, all together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What pissed me off enormously was waiting forever for updates for the Joomla ecomm extensions I&rsquo;ve used in the past. No way I would recreate that which angered me to viscerally. So I did things differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, in so doing, I learned a valuable lesson:&nbsp;<em>the process is the code.</em>&nbsp;Akin, methinks, to Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The Medium is the Message</a>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about the code. It&rsquo;s about code creation. My long term goal with LaSalleMart was to have the ability to create code. Create lots of code. Create lots of code fast. Deliver that code to live sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the sound of a feature that never makes it to a real site? It&rsquo;s the sound of money that can&rsquo;t be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A massive component only gets more massive. Get small, get &ldquo;nichy&rdquo;, release fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the short run, it hardly made sense to get so caught up in the process of creating code. But, get caught up in the process I did. And this month, it is starting to pay off. What an investment in time and energy &mdash; and learning!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month I tried something I&rsquo;ve never done before: could I create four components from scratch in one single day? How&rsquo;s that for putting &ldquo;code creation&rdquo; to the test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each component has a strictly niche purpose. Each component uses just one database, an unusual luxury. Each component will use the Akeeba Live Update to update on real sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two tricks: basing each component on a generic set-up; and, using the Akeeba Framework-on-Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The generic set-up includes build scripts, update processes, file and folder structure, pre-fabricated manifest files &mdash; all the overhead is baked right in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The awesome Framework-on-Framework relieves us of the necessity of creating standard Joomla stuff that all components require. Parsing URLs, creating forms, etc etc. &nbsp;The FoF takes a huge burden off our hands, speeding development in so doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF did not come into the LaSalleMart picture for the longest time. To many antecedents. Standard build scripts needed to happen first. Standard Git workflows &mdash; however rudimentary given how many people are working on the code right now! &mdash; had to be figured out. So many things had to happen first, so many concepts, great and small, had to be brought into technical reality, before FoF would realize its explosive potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month it was finally time to bring on FoF, in the context of &ldquo;Get Small&rdquo; &mdash; with fast turnaround and delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I created com_generic. Then, based on this generic component, I created com_lasallemart_address, com_lasallemart_creditcard, com_lasallemart_manufacturer, and com_foobar_address (a custom component for a custom client project).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, this was the first time I used FoF in a while. And, did I mention, each component is supposed to work in Joomla 3.1?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We program for FoF, and FoF intermediates Joomla. So, using FoF&rsquo;s built-in &ldquo;let me figure out how to do things in the different Joomla version&rdquo; magic, it&rsquo;s possible to build one component that works on both Joomlas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did I produce four new components in a day? Well, no. It turns out that, well, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve done such a thing, and so &nbsp;there are details to figure out. Such as Bootstrap, and the usual doing-for-the-first-time-means-learning-stuff-you&rsquo;d-not-know-if-you-had-not-used-it with FoF. Meaning, my generic component was not finished. But, I am getting there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boy, it&rsquo;s a while ago in 2010. I did a podcast called &ldquo;The Emergence of Nooku Framework Based Joomla eCommerce&rdquo;. Substitute &ldquo;FoF&rdquo; for &ldquo;Nooku&rdquo;. In this podcast I describe the scenario that is now coming to fruition. It&rsquo;s incredible to finally see it come to fruition with LaSalleMart!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y&rsquo;know, not that we need &ldquo;com_lasallemart_manufacturer&rdquo; right now. However, for LaSalleMart 3 for Joomla 3, we will need it. A nice compact little component that manages the &ldquo;#__lasallemart_manufacturers&rdquo; &nbsp;table (oops, the &ldquo;#__lasallemart_manufacturer_items&rdquo; table &mdash; refactor alert!). If we decide we need a new feature for this component, we can Get It Done without touching any other component. How&rsquo;s that for streamlined workflow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 will be a suite of small individual components. As well, it will have a broadened-out library. &ldquo;Getting Small&rdquo; means we can create LM3 over time, instead of as one big bang release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which leads me to into &ldquo;Distros&rdquo;. Joomla has a fantastic potential to create customized distributions that cater to specific needs. &ldquo;Getting Small&rdquo; has the added benefit of being a part of future future distros. We already have a taste of this by the existence of five LM packages. If you live in Canada, you&rsquo;ll want LM Canada. What about a Joomla-LaSalleMart distro for sellers of software? A distro with no shipping, no manufacturer/vendor info &mdash; essentially a slimmed down package. Yes we can! &ldquo;Getting Small&rdquo; makes this very do-able.</p>\r\n', 'The long term has arrived. It is now.

(86, 0, NULL, NULL, 'LaSalleMart State of the Union', 'lasallemart-state-of-the-union', '<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is my Joomla ecommerce extension for Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LM2 is my fork of a free open source Joomla ecomm extension that I grew more and more frustrated with. I decided to take this huge monolithic extension as my own to &ldquo;do something&rdquo; about my frustration. Best thing I ever did!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, LaSalleMart 2.0 for California went live on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2013/live-lasallemart-site\" target=\"_blank\">WonderFoods</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two New LaSalleMart 2.0 sites</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This month, sweet-heart deals were made for two new LM2 sites. These sites should be live by month-end. By &ldquo;sweet-heart&rdquo;, I mean I am putting in free labour. This is it, no more freebies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second site is a client of one of the Toronto Joomla Group consultants. There&rsquo;s some good user testing going on, which is very gratifying. One of the things being tested is the new layout feature developed for the first LM2 site! Without this new feature, Site#2 would be screwed. My own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/lasallemartkb/Category+and+Product+Layouts\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge Base page on my new feature</a>&nbsp;helped me remember what the particulars were &mdash; plus, I realized I left something important out. Designers have a lot more control over the layouts now &mdash; including the add-to-cart form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third site is a very unique site. Long ago we installed Tienda 0.5, one of the first working versions of Tienda. Well, it&rsquo;s not working on this site. So, we (meaning, mostly me) is doing up an entirely new Joomla 2.5 site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, I set up this third LM2 site as a dual Joomla 3.1 &amp; Joomla 2.5 site. The 3.1 site would act as the front-end, for the purpose of utilizing the juicy mobile features. The 2.5 site would house just LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The template we are using has both a 2.5 and 3.1 version, so getting a uniform look is easy (Famous Last Words).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in doing this set-up, the integrations between the sites to accomplish a seamless customer experience require too much work for the benefit received. Technically, no integration is necessary beyond just a link from the 3.1 product pages to the 2.5 LM product pages. So, we can always set-up a dual site in the future. However, mod_cart and the add-to-cart form are just two integrations that &ldquo;trick&rdquo; the buyer into thinking they are on one site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart does not work in Joomla 3.1. However, perhaps instead of bringing LM2 to Joomla 3.1, we should bring Joomla 3.1 to LM2. Bring JUI or Akeeba&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strapper&rdquo; or just plain ol&rsquo; Bootstrap into Joomla 2.5 to get juicy mobile goodness into LM today. We won&rsquo;t do this with Site #3, but we are certainly mindful of it now. Setting up the dual sites was very educational &mdash; absolutely no regrets. Have to push to learn, eh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Site #3 will sell, among other things, downloadable files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New Mandrill Library</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Wanting upcoming LaSalleMart work to take advantage of MailChimp&rsquo;s Mandrill API, I created a<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2013/new-mandrill-library-for-lasallemart\" target=\"_blank\">Mandrill Library for Joomla</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the ecomm action is happening on the tablets. It&rsquo;s imperative that LaSalleMart provide a kick-ass customer experience on the tablets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, people behave differently on different devices. On smartphones they may respond to a link in an email. People do not go through checkout on smartphones. So, your customers will order with a coupon on their phones, but they won&rsquo;t consummate the sale on their phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People will watch videos on their tablets. A video with a link to a pre-coupon&rsquo;d &ldquo;buy now&rdquo; button will work on the tablet. Your customers will go through checkout if the experience is easy and pleasant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Responsive&rdquo; is not enough, because your customers behave differently on different devices. LaSalleMart has to meld with this behaviour, above and beyond the site adjusting to the &ldquo;viewport&rdquo; size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla has something called &ldquo;CLI&rdquo; (command line interface). CLI is Joomla without the site! Akeeba Backup has a CLI &ldquo;app&rdquo; that uses the power of Joomla, and specific Akeeba Backup functions, without launching the site &mdash; and without invoking it via the browser. This is how the automatic backups (via CRON jobs) are done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla&rsquo;s CLI allows for the creation of Joomla based &ldquo;Web Apps&rdquo;. &nbsp;A &ldquo;client-side&rdquo; app is installed on the mobile device. A web application is accessed via a URL on a browser &mdash; nothing is installed on the mobile device. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/overview.html</a>&nbsp;for more info.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the urging of wonderful client, I started building an app to cope with a two staged mobile-driven checkout: the first step is order placement; and, the second step is going through checkout later to pay for the order. I want to create a new LaSalleMart library that can access different aspects of the checkout to cope with this new mobile-based checkout flow. This new library is part of getting LaSalleMart onto Joomla 3. What was many months in the future is now a necessity to respond to the demands of mobile. The future is now, eh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandrill for use with CLI became must-have, as we need to track out-bound emails with our Joomla apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that we control the code puts us at a huge advantage to respond to mobile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On Deck for June</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On deck for development next month:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>wrapping up coupons;</li>\r\n	<li>PayPal Pro;</li>\r\n	<li>streamlined checkout;</li>\r\n	<li>guest checkout;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of the new LM library (on top of the one we already have), I want to wrap up coupons, as it&rsquo;s coming up in conversation now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am working on PayPal Pro, which prompted a new component (com_lasallemart_creditcard).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Streamlining and guest checkout are related. There are too many steps, especially at the address management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;Generic components and the Framework on Framework</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2013/the-long-term-has-arrived\" target=\"_blank\">separate blog post about these</a>, as long term investments are starting to pay off in terms of ability to crank out features faster. Building LM for Joomla 3.x will be ongoing as new development will be as Joomla 3.x friendly as possible. I note this again so you know Joomla 3 (and mobile) is top-of-mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New Home Page</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve not had a front page article for about a month now. Time to gather my notes together and get my new home page article together. I mention it here so you know that my site is not broken!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bringing Club Commerce up to its 300 Members</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In June, I want to do something I&rsquo;ve not done yet: broadening out the tight little group that has brought LaSalleMart to life. &nbsp;LaSalleMart is humming on its first site, with two more upcoming. Development is primed for expansion. It&rsquo;s time &mdash; finally! &mdash; to broaden our tight little group, that I call &ldquo;Club Commerce&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JUGT Presentation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 30th, I&rsquo;m putting on a Joomla ecommerce presentation at the Joomla User Group Toronto&rsquo;s seminar.

So why do so? It is central to the reason why I forked Tienda into LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, I grew increasingly frustrated with Joomla ecommerce extensions. The pattern I observed was these extensions ebbed and flowed. They had their day in the sun when it was great to specialize in &lsquo;em, and then they had a sunset. I was starting to flit from ecommerce extension to ecommerce extension. When an extension was hot, I was there. Riding the popularity of the extension du jour is hardly a way to build long-term consulting revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0221.jpg\"><img alt=\"Bob Bloom at Joomla Toronto ecommerce workshop\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0221-300x224.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:224px; margin:0px 10px 10px; width:300px\" /></a>Just as my revenues were about to take-off, that extension&rsquo;s hotness faded and so did my revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major decision I made was to not become a generalist. I would&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;recommend to clients the best ecommerce solution that fit their needs, and then build this solution or outsource its implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would specialize in an ecommerce technology. But which one? It came down to two ecommerce technologies:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Magento:</li>\r\n	<li>Something Else.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0216.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_0216\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0216-224x300.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin:0px 10px 10px; width:224px\" /></a>So, if not Magento, then I had more figuring out to do, because I did not know what that &ldquo;Something Else&rdquo; was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By far, Magento was the obvious choice. Obvious!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my estimation, Magento was the only &mdash; ONLY! &mdash; ecommerce technology that I had confidence would last in the long term. In five years, which ecomm technology would be standing? How could I build my revenue and business asset value over the long term without an ecomm technology that would stand the test of time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magento was the only &mdash; ONLY! &mdash; technology that had a real reseller program. This is very meaningful to me, because there is a real relationship between the technology providers and those who provide value-added services to clients in implementing this technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, in a fundamental way, in my own eyes, Magento smoked Joomla, WordPress, Drupal, and the bevy of independent PHP carts. It was not even close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The accountant in me, the project manager in me, the business analyst in me, the programmer in me &mdash; the sum total of my professional life told me to run, not walk, to Magento. A very cold ruthless calculation spoke to me clearly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0217.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_0217\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0217-224x300.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:300px; margin:0px 10px 10px; width:224px\" /></a>Yet, I walked away from Magento and ran to Joomla!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing Joomla was a very significant and profound decision for me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the benefits of choosing Joomla, and the terms in which I would choose it, underlie all that I do with Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting up in front of people that I know &mdash; hey, it&rsquo;s a JUGT presentation, not a JoomlaDay presentation &mdash; and not getting to The Real Story &mdash; I don&rsquo;t think so!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two reasons why I walked away from Magento:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>could not run the community edition;</li>\r\n	<li>a visceral reaction to eBay buying out its founders.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is it that I just couldn&rsquo;t get Magento community edition to work? I tried and tried and tried. Installation was cumbersome. Using the sample data was cumbersome. Updating was impossible for me &mdash; each update crashed my install. With Magento, I had a reverse Midas Touch: I turned gold into lead, not lead into gold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If memory serves, eBay already had an equity interest in Magento when they decided to buy out the founders completely. My reaction was visceral &mdash; I found it quite revolting. My Spidey-sense told me this was bad for me long-term. It wasn&rsquo;t one thing, it was a bunch of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0222.jpg\"><img alt=\"Bob Bloom at Joomla Toronto ecommerce workshop\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/IMG_0222-300x224.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:224px; margin:0px 10px 10px; width:300px\" /></a>I was convinced that I&rsquo;d be just like a ton of other consultants: chasing down clients. We&rsquo;d all be Magento resellers. We&rsquo;d all be assigned the same Support One techs. We&rsquo;d all get letters every quarter from the same Assistant Executive Vice-President in Charge of the Colony of Eastern Canada. We&rsquo;d all know where the Magento Bodies are Buried, so we knew revenue-versus-costs of the main scenarios we&rsquo;d be implementing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d be a commodity. I&rsquo;d be just like everyone else. Commodities compete on one thing in the end, and you know what that is: price. And no way I could compete on price. You know why? Because the other consultants would have either 15 year old geniuses paid in Apple Store gift certificates, along with a slew of behind-the-old-iron-curtain coders they&rsquo;ve been dealing with for 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m exaggerating. But, how would I differentiate myself? Well, Joomla. I already knew Joomla, and there&rsquo;s a Joomla-Magento bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah, always back to Joomla. And, well, of course, I couldn&rsquo;t get Magento to work. Oil-meets-water!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I was gravitating away from Joomla, but in so gravitating, I was coming back. When I was looking at &ldquo;Something Else&rdquo;, I was always comparing to Joomla. The templating, the CMS features, the ease-of-use. The ability to add a social site, or a subscription site&hellip; always &ldquo;coming home&rdquo; to Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, I had to face up to the fact that the Joomla ecomm extensions were damaging my business. So, how to &ldquo;come home&rdquo; to Joomla yet advance my business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did I reconcile the &ldquo;returning to Joomla&rdquo; with the &ldquo;walking away from Joomla&rdquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The General Public Licence&rdquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t really believe what the GPL really means. Coming from the Corporate IT world, it did not really &ldquo;click&rdquo; with me. Ah, then it did!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made an astounding leap: instead of using other peoples&rsquo; ecommerce software,&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;d use my own</em>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building my own ecommerce software turned into quite the journey, and quite the investment! And certainly looking at the Joomla ecommerce world a lot differently than I ever did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unconventional story, but a story of the path I pursued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A path I wanted to convey at the presentation.</p>\r\n', 'Devoting a Joomla ecommerce presentation to an exposition of website asset value is unconventional.

It was a thorough hands-on interactive workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 people in attendence (4-ish known regrets) had a great range of skills and experience with Bootstrap &mdash; and Bootstrap for Joomla. There were questions from the floor &nbsp; non-stop, and great cross conversations too &mdash; thank you Niv for your patience! The regulars are certainly getting to know each other as there was a lot of participation and chatter. It was lively, informal, and very informative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get to the hands-on stuff as fast as possible, and to keep the lessons on point, Niv purposefully focused on just the Bootstrap Framework. A few of us attendees, me included, kept yapping about Bootstrap working with Joomla. Niv did the exact right approach keeping the hands-on lessons purely Bootstrap, since that&rsquo;s what we were there to learn. However, we certainly made it know how relevant all this was to Joomla!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, I think it&rsquo;s time JUGT hosted a &ldquo;Tour of Joomla&rdquo; workshop. I get the impression from this evening that many people are not aware of JoomlaCLI &mdash; and its potential for creating Joomla web applications. I am not sure that some attendees are aware of the Joomla media folder, where JUI resides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having done quite a number of workshops this fall-winter-spring, the experience is starting to show. The rough edges are starting to smooth out. The venue was very very good, and without the eariler efforts we&rsquo;d not have found our way to Conference Room 2 this evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My goal was to understand what &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; really means with the Framework, and how the Framework achieves &ldquo;responsive&rdquo;. Mission accomplished. I realized that I was tripping over the terminology. I also understand that Bootstrap is a templating framework as well as a responsive framework. It was good to see it in action! We definitely need a follow-up workshop about LESS (and Mix-ins) &mdash; but this time let&rsquo;s use LESS in Joomla context!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well done, Alan, Niv, Vic, Doug, et al!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Powerpoint is on my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/lasallemartkb/Bootstrap\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleMart Knowledge Base</a>.</p>\r\n', 'This evening’s Bootstrap Workshop, hosted by the Joomla User Group Toronto, was exceptionally good.', 'This evening’s Bootstrap Workshop, hosted by the Joomla User Group Toronto, was exceptionally good.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/june-2013-joomla-user-group-toronto-bootstrap-workshop', 'IMG_0327.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2013-06-19', '2013-06-19 12:00:00', 1, '2013-06-19 12:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

Now I am building the first suite of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; LaSalleMart 3 components, plugins, and module. But in so building, I have discovered that I am prototyping again with the &ldquo;live&rdquo; LM3, in order to see if the concepts will work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, they do, especially using views in one component in another component. This one FoF feature is having profound effects on LaSalleMart 3. Or, perhaps, I should put it this way: HMVC is enabling a long-held vision of Joomla ecommerce to come to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 is initially comprised of a suite of nine components, three plugins, and one module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is to stick to FoF conventions in order to build a clean, straight forward, and deeply powerful Joomla ecommerce technology, which I call LaSalleMart 3. So far, it is working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a component devoted solely to products, called com_product (ok, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;com_lmproduct&rdquo;). This component&rsquo;s view that displays a single product on the website contains a view from the &ldquo;com_lmcart&rdquo; cart component. Specifically, the &ldquo;addtocart&rdquo; view, which displays perfectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HMVC means it is possible to have a ton of small limited-scope components. So far it is working very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There really is less code. The usual coding overhead that Joomla requires for custom components is missing. It is practically a culture shock keeping to the FoF&rsquo;s mandated MVC structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 is becoming something very very different than what I&rsquo;m used to for Joomla ecommerce. Something that gives it a shot at not becoming obsolete so quickly. Something that is terrific for mobile. Something that is readable by the human eye. Something that follows a consistent discipline based on Joomla&rsquo;s own MVC. Something that is condusive to huge development effort instead of bottlenecking it.</p>\r\n', 'Chatting tonight with attendees of my Joomla User Group Toronto ecommerce presentation, I mentioned that my long held vision of Joomla ecommerce is starting to come to fruition with LaSalleMart 3...', 'Chatting tonight with attendees of my Joomla User Group Toronto ecommerce presentation, I mentioned that my long held vision of Joomla ecommerce is starting to come to fruition with LaSalleMart 3...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/long-held-vision-of-joomla-ecommerce-is-coming-to-fruition-with-lasallemart-3', 'periscope_with_hand1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2013-10-23', '2013-10-23 12:00:00', 1, '2013-10-23 12:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

Start with the last steps of checkout work your way backwards &mdash; mainly payment methods and shipping methods, along with SSL. Checkout takes time to implement, so you need to get your hands around it when you start your ecomm site. Most clients obsess about products and eye-candy and leave checkout towards the end of their site development &mdash; big mistake!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I emphasized that SEO stops at checkout; and, that once in checkout the issue of cart abandonment becomes the key driver of development decision making. Unfortunately, the emphasis on the &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; eye candy leaves little budget left over for checkout customization, which is another big mistake.&nbsp;I displayed an info-graphic on cart abandonment to emphasize typical abandonment issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>eCommerce is not just a cart &mdash; it&rsquo;s running a subscription site, events, and courses. It&rsquo;s combining a bunch of front-end e-marketing &nbsp;+ sales into a cohesive whole &mdash; like email marketing, blogging, white papers, SEO, AdSense, and the cart. There is also &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; processing &mdash; offline order processing, QuickBooks integration, refund administration, etc. We barely touched on these aspects of ecommerce &mdash; which&nbsp;&nbsp;speaks to the wide scope of ecommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember: backwards!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/bbloom9/2013-oct22-jugtecommerceworkshop\">http://www.slideshare.net/bbloom9/2013-oct22-jugtecommerceworkshop</a></p>\r\n', 'So my intention with this presentation was to emphasize the mechanics of creating a Joomla ecomm website.', 'So my intention with this presentation was to emphasize the mechanics of creating a Joomla ecomm website.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/my-october-2013-joomla-user-group-toronto-ecommerce-presentation', 'jugt_listing1.png', 1, 0, 0, '2013-10-23', '2013-10-23 12:00:00', 1, '2013-10-23 12:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),
(96, 0, NULL, NULL, 'Dear Clients – Progressive Billing Only', 'progressive-billing-only', '<p>This Halloween month-end featured a haunting accounts receivable: would my client pay his final payment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was haunted by the pins-and-needles feeling of wondering if a significant amount would actually be paid. Reminded me of my earlier days of freelancing, especially one guy who took that final payment hostage. This final payment situation turned into a hostage situation, and I decided that no more would I do a deposit-plus-final-payment engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two aspects to this: the human-nature aspect; and, the criminal aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is human nature to not want to accept a project.&nbsp;No one wants to sign-off. In my corporate IT days, and in my freelancing, people hate having to explicitly decide that yes, indeed, the thing is done .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What works is doing things smaller. Clients understand fixes: the thing is broken, I fix it, they see it for themselves, they are happy, they pay. &nbsp; Clients understand tweaks: the thing needs an improvement, I improve it, the see it for themselves, they are happy, they pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem comes when there are too many things going on. With a new site, there are a lot of things going on. The client is not comfortable with blessing everything, so is hesitant. At the end of site development, clients are &nbsp;nervous. So, they are hesitant to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Criminal behaviour goes beyond a natural hesitation. It&rsquo;s just exploitation. It&rsquo;s extracting free labour. The proposition is: I will pay you after you do these extra things. Of course, the successful extraction of free labour begets further rounds of extortion. And, at the end, why even pay the final invoice?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, no more deposit-plus-final-payment engagements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progress-billings.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Progressive Billing</a>&nbsp;from now on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My big policy decision is not going to change a thing when it comes to fixes and tweaks. I do the work first, and then I bill at the end</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What will change is how I do soup-to-nuts website development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequently, it&rsquo;s not deposit-plus-final-billing that is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; problem. The underlying problem is that<em>scope is never known beforehand</em>. And, or,&nbsp;<em>the work required to achieve that scope is under-estimated</em>. Either way, more work is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, deposit-plus-final-payment becomes a fixed price arrangement. The problem for me is that the potential work I do is open-ended. Which incentivizes my client to get me working as much as possible. So there&rsquo;s the crescendo of BTW &mdash; &ldquo;by the way, do X&rdquo;, &ldquo;by the way, do Y&rdquo;. It does not take long for it to become &ldquo;by the way, do Z, or else I will not pay the final payment!&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Progressive billing means that I complete a chunk of work, and then you pay me for that chunk of work. Then, I do another chunk of work, and you pay me for that chunk of work. If we get tired of each other, we do not schedule another chunk of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not going to be your mouse-on-the-wheel. I&rsquo;m not going to be held to a fixed cost while faced with unbounded work. I may be freelance, but I&rsquo;m more &ldquo;lance&rdquo; than &ldquo;free&rdquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; your new site development, and you&rsquo;ll pay as we go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', ' I may be freelance, but I am more “lance” than “free”!', ' I may be freelance, but I am more “lance” than “free”!', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/progressive-billing-only', 'interview1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2013-11-03', '2013-11-03 14:00:00', 1, '2013-11-03 14:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

Why? Because there is more money in software creation than software consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software is a wasting asset. You have a money making Joomla 1.5 site? How much can you sell your site for? It&rsquo;s on Joomla 1.5, so subtract the cost of upgrading the site to Joomla 3 from its asset value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, open source software is made to be modified. It is valuable to customize open source software &mdash; in fact, the GPL license explicitly allows you to do so. Managing your modifications so that you can still merge native upgrades with your customizations is very important to unleashing value. To do so, you have to set your site up with software development infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I urge my clients to own their domain registration &amp; management, own their website hosting account (not with their domain registrar), and own their own site. Separate your consultants from your domain and hosting. I am very insistent on this, and very different from other consultants who are only too glad to be in control of your domain and your website. You have to own and control that which will accrue value to you. If I effectively control your site, then its value accrues to me first! In fact, if the address associated with your domain is me &mdash; not you! &mdash; then I effectively own your domain because you can&rsquo;t sell it without my permission. Keep this in mind when you sign up for a SaaS ecomm site, the relationship between code consumption and creation &amp; control and value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also urge my clients to sign up and use basic software infrastructure sites. At the very minimum, sign up for GitHub.com. It is no secret that I prefer Atlassian. com: their BitBucket.org software repositories, their JIRA issue tracker, their Confluence collaboration offering, and their HipChat offering, among their other offerings. Why? Because these tools add value to your website. It means you can create software to meet your needs. It means you can manage open source software over time to extract the most value from &lsquo;em. It also means you have a form of built-in disaster recovery/business continuity. It also means you have a way of scaling out your site with project &amp; development infrastructure that will accommodate more people working on your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients repeatedly say no to using Atlassian.com, GitHub.com, Assembla.com, or any other site. It is a &ldquo;tough sell&rdquo; &mdash; no, it is an impossible sell! Despite exquisitely explaining the rationale on my podcasts and blog, despite the insanely nominal cost signing up for these value-adding offerings, despite the unbelievable amount of free development software in the Linux world, I cannot convince my clients. It is too technical, I am told. It feels too much like a way of passing site control into the hands of the consultants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I will continue to insist! Because it&rsquo;s &nbsp;really about learning a new technical area. An area that I am learning about all the time.

A special thank you to Doug and Alison who worked hard to make this evening happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, two founding members of JUGT were en route to Boston for the Joomla World Conference while Jen was en route to Toronto for the PHP conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had a good turnout, and the North York Civic Centre is a very good venue. JUGT has come a long way. As this evening progressed, I thought that we are ready to arrange a JoomlaDay Toronto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was great to talk about Joomla with others in person, with Joomla 3.2 just released and so many Joomla-LaSalleMart ideas dancing in my head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a question Jen asked me that galvanized my thoughts about Joomla 3.2. The latest Bootstrap Framework version is version 3. But Joomla 3.2 comes with Bootstrap v2. How can one use the latest Bootstrap in the latest Joomla? My answer is that you keep the existing Bootstrap in the &ldquo;media/jui&rdquo; folder, and put the new Bootstrap in a new &ldquo;/media/bv3&Prime; folder, and use &lsquo;em side by side. There may be issues with different javascript libraries and perhaps loading too many css files, but these are things best delved into with a fresh install and a test custom component. I pointed out that anyone using Akeeba Backup already has side-by-side Bootstraps installed &mdash; notice the installation of &ldquo;Strapper&rdquo; the next time you do an AB update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While explaining this, I realized how truly excited I am about Joomla 3.2. This version of Joomla is the first&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/jenkgraphic560jugt.jpg\"><img alt=\"jenkgraphic560jugt\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/jenkgraphic560jugt-300x199.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:199px; margin:0px 0px 10px 10px; width:300px\" /></a>version, in my mind, to be seriously kick-ass as a development platform. It took a long while to get to this point, a very steady progression, and now we are at Joomla 3.2. The Framework on Framework is included. There is Ajax built in &mdash; that I have to learn about (hopefully the JWC workshop on this will be on video). There are a lot of goodies to dig into that contribute to this version of Joomla being very good for dev work. In a sense, in my opinion, Joomla&rsquo;s turned a corner where building custom Joomla extensions will be the smarter choice rather than customizing an existing extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put another way, I&rsquo;d not have put it to clients to build from scratch in the past. I&rsquo;d recommend tweaking an existing extension and templates exclusively over building from scratch. But now, for the same effort, you could have just built a fresh custom extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought again that now is the perfect time to be building a Joomla Distribution. A &ldquo;distro&rdquo; is a custom version of Joomla that retains the integrity of Joomla; and, includes the Joomla updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I mentioned my already starting work on my Joomla 3.2 distro, Jen asked me about the now defunct Square One distro. I really appreciate you asking me to &ldquo;compare and contrast&rdquo; with Square One, Jen! Thank you! Really really good question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/2013-11-07-19.12.52.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/2013-11-07-19.12.52-224x300.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin:0px 0px 10px 10px; width:224px\" /></a>Square One was a terrific effort to create a custom Joomla 2.5 distribution. One of the goals was to create a &ldquo;lean and mean&rdquo; version of Joomla, where the optional Joomla extensions that come with Joomla become separate installable extensions like any other third party extension. Then, the idea was to add features to Joomla that were not in native Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My LaSalleCMS will be a Joomla that works hand-in-hand with LaSalleMart to provide a holistic unified Joomla-ecommerce experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My LaSalleCMS will make the Joomla development experience even better. Especially with creating development for web apps. Square One was about the user experience. My distro is more for the development experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which goes hand in hand with Joomla becoming a premier development platform. At the time, improving Joomla for users was the thing to do. Now, I see it as kicking up the development experience &mdash; which in turn improves the user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This evening was not Joomla from a user perspective. It was about Joomla from a development perspective. This is part-and-parcel of the way Joomla is progressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really do believe that there is a greater value to being a software producer, not a software consumer. Joomla itself is, in my opinion, &nbsp;a terrific platform for producing software. As opposed to the Joomla project delivering something that solely satisfies the user experience. Joomla 3.2 is made for custom development &mdash; which is where significant website value resides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really good workshop this evening!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"356\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/28044124\" width=\"427\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/jen4web/twitter-bootstrap-vs-zurb-foundation\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Bootstrap vs ZURB Foundation Version 3</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jen4web\" target=\"_blank\">Jen Kramer</a></strong></p>\r\n', 'Thank  you to Jen Kramer who delivered a fabulous workshop on Bootstrap and Foundation responsive frameworks.

Plus, every time there was a new Joomla version (!), the complete reverse engineering exercise had to be repeated. The Square One project devolved Joomla into about 150 separate installable pieces -- an enormous achievement.

My LaSalleCMS domain and website have been set-up and ready for much of this year.</p>\n\n<p>So all was ready for the day Joomla 3.2 was released. The day it came out (<a href=\"http://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5516-joomla-3-2-0-stable-released.html\" target=\"_blank\">last week</a>), I dropped everything and began creating my first LaSalleCMS Distro package from it. The first round goal: &nbsp;just initialize everything: the builds, the repo, and whatever is required to set it up. There is just one Distro package, and it is exactly Joomla, with nary a change. Ah, but LaSalleCMS now exists! The builds work, the update works (mostly), the Atlassian suite is set-up, LaSalleCMS is modified. This journey has taken its first step.</p>\n\n<p>There is barely a hint in the Administrator that you are even using LaSalleCMS. You&rsquo;ll notice the version is &ldquo;3.2.0000&Prime; instead of &ldquo;3.2.0&Prime;. The Joomla Updater says &ldquo;LaSalleCMS&rdquo;. Well, I decided to heck with any branding, let&rsquo;s just get this thing set up technically, as (surprise!) it needed more work and TLC than I anticipated.</p>\n\n<p>Now that it is set-up, I can start working on pet issues. I will create JIRA issues for these. Before I get moving on these, I will turn my focus back to LaSalleMart 3. Doing LM3 from scratch, I need to get it to a stage where development can explode.

At some point there will be Distro packages that omit some components/modules/plugins that ship with Joomla. But it&rsquo;s too early for that! I am also intrigued that there may be separate repositories for these extensions maintained by Joomla &mdash; but we&rsquo;re getting ahead of ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>The open source license Joomla uses allows people to create and distribute Distro packages.</p>\n\n<p>The essence of a Distro is: the integrity of the underlying software is preserved.</p>\n\n<p>Joomla updates will be merged into LaSalleCMS.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not turning Joomla into something else &mdash; it&rsquo;s always Joomla.</p>\n\n<p>Why do Distros?</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>To actively manage Joomla for security and added functionality;</li>\n	<li>To pair it with LaSalleMart to create a holistic Joomla ecommerce experience;</li>\n	<li>Deeper understanding of Joomla;</li>\n	<li>Moneyball: value is producing software, not consuming it. &ldquo;Producing&rdquo; Joomla opens up opportunities my clients &amp; I would not otherwise enjoy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>UPDATE WHILE INPUTTING MY WORDPRESS POSTS TO MY LARAVEL BLOG APP (Aug 2014):These are things you&rsquo;ve heard me talk about on my podcasts for a while.

This requires the basics to be in place: products, add-to-cart, cart, shipping, payment, order creation.

These need to flow in checkout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This initial &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; version needs a data model! Probably a partial source of today&rsquo;s frustration is my lack of a data model, so will take some time out from the PHP to do a ERD, which will turn into SQL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not set on the order, but for now&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alpha 2&Prime;: cart management using database tables (&ldquo;Alpha 1&Prime; will use session variables).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alpha3&Prime;: site registration and address management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From here on, there are feature sets to build out to get to the &ldquo;Beta&rdquo; version of LM3.

Yes, the proof-of-concept affirmed the concept. But, now it&rsquo;s time to use these concepts &ldquo;for real&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something I&rsquo;ve never done before is developing a family of related components, modules, and plugins. How are these relations actually effected using the superb Akeeba Framework on Framework &mdash; which now ships with Joomla starting with J!3.2. Are there issues related to relating extensions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LM3 Alpha1 is comprised of nine components, one module, and three plugins:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>com_lmaddress (address management component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lmcart (cart component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lmcheckout (checkout component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lmcoupon (coupon component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lasallemart (flagship component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lmorder (order processing and management component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lmpayment (payment engine component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lmproduct (product component &mdash; will be integrated with Joomla&rsquo;s article (content) component);</li>\r\n	<li>com_lmshipping (shipping engine component);</li>\r\n	<li>mod_lmcart (cart module);</li>\r\n	<li>plg_content_lmaddtocart (add-to-cart content plugin);</li>\r\n	<li>plg_system_lmsystem (LaSalleMart3&prime;s system plugin);</li>\r\n	<li>plg_user_lmuser (LaSalleMart3&prime;s user plugin).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of effort went into creating the builds, installation, and update routines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unexpected outcome of Alpha1 was the new concept of The Flagship Component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, the LaSalleMart component was about to be deleted as, true to the idea of not having a single massive component; but, instead, having a lot of targeted components, there was no identifiable function for com_lasallemart. I nearly ended up having LaSallemart3 not having a com_lasallemart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the config and database became issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I really want each component having its own settings? Well, yes and no. For &ldquo;no&rdquo;, I needed one place for all LaSalleMart3-wide settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A component always has the database tables it requires. Right? Wrong! For the first time ever in my Joomla experience, components are installed without their database. Instead, only the LaSalleMart3 flagship component installs the database &mdash; for all of LaSalleMart3. Breaking up the integrated data model is going to introduce complexity and errors for no payoff, just so each component can install &amp; maintain its own piece of LaSalleMart3.&nbsp;The data model is going to become quite involved, so it needs to be managed as a single entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus was born the flagship component, com_lasallemart! Now, its inherent lack of identity is a plus, being available for the config, LaSalleMart3 specific reporting, and database management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new requirement that cropped up was the need for com_lasallemart to be installed first, but uninstalled last, amongst all LaSalleMart3 extentions. That database needs to exist first! And an involved, populated, database can&rsquo;t be deleted just because its attendent component was mistakenly deleted. Having worked with a list of thirteen components starting with &ldquo;LM3&Prime; in Joomla&rsquo;s Extension Manager, I can see all too clearly clicking the wrong box at oh-dark-hundred and instantly zapping the entire database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the flagship component must be installed first, and uninstalled last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also built in a history of LaSalleMart3 extensions&rsquo; installation, upgrading, and un-installation. With so many extensions I will need this history to diagnose problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So a dominant feature of Alpha1 is its unexpected installation routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha1&prime;s overall functionality is limited. Products can be entered, and viewed in the front-end. The views are rudimentary, yet it&rsquo;s all done in FoF. The product component fetches the add-to-cart view from the add-to-cart component &mdash; no plugin needed! It&rsquo;s very exciting to see this work &mdash; well, it is for me! The add-to-cart form within the product layout uses the add-to-cart component to process. At first, cart info was stored in session variables, but that was dropped in favour of using new cart database tables. So the add-to-cart form saves to the database tables, using FoF all the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My defining experience using FoF is deleting code. And files. And folders. It astounds me how much code is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;needed. As long as I stick to FoF conventions, FoF will take care of the heavy lifting. It&rsquo;s always tempting to pull a Frank Sinatra and do it &ldquo;My Way&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s a very costly indulgence. There&rsquo;s a lot of goodness packed into FoF, so why subvert it? A part of learning The FoF Way was deleting files. Yes, FoF really does require less code &mdash; if you stick to its conventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another defining FoF experience was adding the term &ldquo;MVC Triad&rdquo; to my Joomla lexicon. Never has such joy been encapsulated by such a dry technical label. Thank you, FoF!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha1 was originally supposed to flow through the entire checkout sequence, to include the shipping and payment components. With the expanded installation routine, and the success of the add-to-cart piece (without the plugin!), scope was truncated and Alpha1 was wrapped up. Hello continuous development mentality! Sometimes, just use time as the cut-off. The essential outcomes were achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All thirteen extensions install, even though most don&rsquo;t do anything. And, the administrator side is not even tested &mdash; I know that I have an Akeeba Strapper issue, but given the front-end focus of Alpha1, why worry about it right now? I would love to use Bootstrap 3 anyways&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the flagship component must be installed first, and the others must un-install ahead of it. The database installs &mdash; and uninstalls. The installs work on LaSalleCMS, my Joomla 3.2 Distro &mdash; but there is a pending versioning issue that cropped up, but can wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, the initial order processing works. As a stand-alone process, the FoF-based order processing works. Order processing requires intensive database updating, so I wanted to get a sense in Alpha1 what FoF requires for multiple table INSERTs. I&rsquo;ll tell you this: I had to delete code!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha1 excludes address management, because this is a sub-system, not just a one-off form to whip up. Addressing it (pun intended) would have distracted away from the key Alpha1 outcomes. Basically, Alpha1 is the first &ldquo;getting out of the lab&rdquo; release, with the focus on using FoF in the practical production environment. It&rsquo;s a bit early to worry about address management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha2 will use rudimentary shipping and payment checkout steps in order for LaSalleMart3 to flow through checkout. There will be no address management. This may end up being all of Alpha2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha3 will focus on the add-to-cart subsystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha4 will focus on address management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, development is ready to explode. The goal to achieve LaSalleMart3&prime;s first Beta release is to replicate the functions in LaSalleMart2, which included a detailed standard shippping, integrated site registration/address management/checkout workflow, product attributes, PayPal Standard, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha3 and Alpha4 can be done concurrently, so the time to step on the gas is now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2013/lasallemart24\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleMart News #24 (Dec 2013): LM3 Alpha One Achieved</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lasallemart.com/index.php/lasallemart3-vision\" target=\"_blank\">Vision of LaSalleMart3</a></p>\r\n', 'I am thrilled to tell you that LaSalleMart3′s initial Alpha release is achieved.

The last few weeks of Holidays were the perfect time to go dark. Although I came up for air to do a little podcast, I need to compliment it with a blog post. Then, I&rsquo;m going dark a little bit more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This afternoon was devoted to LaSalleMart&rsquo;s add-to-cart plugin. A necessary adjunct to the Joomla article and LaSalleMart product tables integration, this plugin displays LaSalleMart&rsquo;s add-to-cart form in a Joomla article. The twist is using the Framework on Framework, which allows the plugin to act as a conduit &mdash; a pipeline if you will &mdash; between Joomla&rsquo;s article and LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am trying very hard to avoid using plugins, and am succeeding so far. One reason is what I perceive as abuse and overuse in general. Another reason is favouring the use of components as the full flower of Joomla is truly available when programming with components. Taking plugins back to first principles, plugins should &ldquo;fire events&rdquo; when necessary; and, should act as conduits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart has, hopefully, the only suite of plugins that it needs: a system plugin; a user plugin; a content plugin; and the add-to-cart content plugin. The three other plugins are essentially placeholders, set-up now as a convenience if (when) they are needed. The user plugin will likely have events associated with user login to deal with session_id&rsquo;s in LaSalleMart&rsquo;s cart table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This afternoon I knew I was onto something when I&nbsp;<em>deleted code</em>&nbsp;in my add-to-cart plugin. Deleting code is a frequent exercise as I program with the Framework on Framework (which now ships with Joomla 3.2). Today I created a template for my plugin. Then, later on, I deleted it. &nbsp;Instead, I finally got a view in my component to render in my plugin, to display in a Joomla article:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<code>// Output buffering<br />\r\n@ob_start();<br />\r\necho $view-&gt;loadAnyTemplate(&#39;site:com_lmcart/addtocart/default&#39;);<br />\r\n$output = @ob_get_clean();</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Get the add-to-cart form in the Joomla article!<br />\r\n$article-&gt;text = str_replace($matches[0][0], $output, $article-&gt;text);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exactly what I was trying to achieve! The layout in my cart component renders directly in my plugin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this key linkage achieved, the build-out will include layouts built exclusively for my plugin, controlled administratively from my component. Instead having a ton of plugin parameters that need manual specification within the plugin code (that sits in the Joomla article), my hope is that one lonely parameter is all that&rsquo;s needed. The multitude of parameters will instead reside within the component (not the plugin), and rendered through rules the component&rsquo;s controller carries out. A build-out that will not happen by this current month-end, mind you! Getting there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step-by-step, my vision is working out. This plugin is extraordinarily lean, the code is exceptionally readable. It helps that I am deleting code, not adding to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart displays products from its product table. Alternatively, Joomla articles can represent products. Both options have a working add-to-cart form. Furthermore, right now, the add-to-cart form is the exact same form! Although this has a nice symmetry, you&rsquo;re eyes will appreciate using different layouts later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product and add-to-cart nexus are functionally done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What has cropped up is the use of different Bootstrap versions. Joomla uses Bootstrap 2.3.2. The newer templates properly use Bootstrap 3. So, I am in the process of having LaSalleMart use both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project plan I have is a good basis for going off on twists and turns. When I created the plan of what features would encompass which Alpha release packages, I had not the slightest thought about the two Bootstrap versions. However, in the doing I realized I had to &ldquo;do something&rdquo;. &nbsp;These things take time, but it&rsquo;s time well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I still see a good chance of releasing LaSalleMart3 version one point oh at the end of January.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basis of optimism is seeing LaSalleMart staying lean and clean &mdash; so far! As I am building the basics right now, I am keeping close to the Framework on Framework conventions, straying as little as I can in order to get the most FoF benefits. &nbsp;I will build the administration forms along these lines, so you will see what seem like a lot of little forms that could be bundled up for convenience. That convenience is not worth the programming right now. It&rsquo;s better to build the forms along FoF lines first anyways to get a stronger feel of how FoF works. We can consolidate forms later, if need be. I suspect that the real issue is workflow, not form consolidation, so: first the forms, then the workflow. If I can somehow keep the administration forms XML based, instead of writing PHP based forms, I can speed up the creation of these admin forms, freeing up time on the other stuff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That other stuff is features I was hoping to deal with after doing a bare-bones production release. But, alas, what seemed fine on paper when I first put my release packages together is not looking realistic in the doing. Without building out the product heft a little more, a production LaSalleMart site will be too bare-bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need to pretend I am a user and give the LaSalleMart I&rsquo;ve accomplished so far a whirl. So I will create a new site from scratch, using the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://t3-framework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Base Joostrap template</a>&nbsp;to see LaSalleMart in a real Bootstrap 3 set-up. I am very sure there will be a number of rough edges to smooth out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once smoothed out, I will do the product quantity feature set; and, the product attribute feature set. Originally, I was to omit these product feature sets. But, I&rsquo;d rather build these features, rather than the hooks in anticipation of these features coming. These are showstopper features anyways, so I figure if I stick close to the Framework, I can still meet a January month-end production release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My hope is that the product feature sets will be complete by Friday, January 17th. The product and cart components, the cart module, and the add-to-cart plugin. The #__content and #__lmproduct_items tables are integrated, the add-to-cart works, the cart itself works. Looking forward to a quick user-styled test of what I have, and then move on to product quantity and product attributes. These relate intimately with price, which is a Big Reason to get these done now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, I will call this &ldquo;LaSalleMart3 Alpha2&Prime;. I will create a private demo site for a specific private audience, and then progress to address management, shipping, payment, order processing, and order management. Somewhere in there I have to sneak in taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By address management, I mean billing and shipping addresses. Nothing fancy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By shipping, I exclude all shipping companies. Right now, I am talking strictly manual shipping methods. In part, I want to test using components for shipping, rather than plugins. So a few shipping components. Digging into shipping is not for this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By payments, I mean &ldquo;purchase order&rdquo; payment and PayPal Standard. That&rsquo;s it. Again, I will use components for each payment method, not plugins. Digging into payments is not for this month. Not that doing PayPal Standard is exactly trivial&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Order processing will be involved. So, order management will be minimal. I am hot to have back-end order initiation, which is something that is not realistic to have in the first production release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is progressing. My social life and social media life may not progress as much this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look for a progress report not this weekend, but the weekend next.</p>\r\n', 'This afternoon was devoted to LaSalleMart’s add-to-cart plugin.

Great! But, um, I made a mistake: regardless of a LaSallemart component&rsquo;s existence on a website, its icon appears in the flagship component. So&hellip; have to programmatically confirm the existence of each component first. Good thing I took the time to create a LaSalleMart installation history database table, eh! I am pretty sure that I cheated, putting calls to the model in the actual view file &mdash; but, it is direct and human-readable!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also took a nice little tour of Joomla&rsquo;s JSession and #__session table. Not having occassion to delve into sessions in my regular Joomla experiences, this tour represented a new learning opportunity. Maybe not one I wanted! I have set (and get) custom session variables before, but this is the first time I ended up going through the source code, and studying the database table. All this in pursuit of managing the cart database table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another little expedition was triggered by an interesting question in the Akeeba Framework on Framework Google Group. The question asked about the new Joomla profile plugin. What is a &ldquo;profile plugin&rdquo;? Is this something that can help me with my upcoming LaSalleMart Address Management component?

However, I will defer (the bulk of) this topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blogging and ecommerce go together like chocolate and peanut butter. So much so that I take it as axiomatic that ecommerce site owners blog. So much so that I&rsquo;ve made great efforts to use Joomla&rsquo;s native article facility for LaSalleMart product pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And barely any ecommerce client I&rsquo;ve had since I started freelancing has actually blogged. I will hazard a guess that 10% of my ecomm clients blogged in any way, shape, or form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google loves original content. So, blogging is a must &mdash; a must!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many clients of my clients over the years look to SEO as an instant fix pill to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; sales? Most. But blogging? Feh! That&rsquo;s effort!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took immense joy at hearing the presenters tell us how the old SEO tricks are falling by the wayside. I do like the tidbit that Google updates its search algorithm multiple times per day. How&rsquo;s that for an ode to continuous software development!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blogging is more than that, you know. &nbsp;Blogging is your strategic advantage. Blogging is how your potential buyers get to know you. It&rsquo;s how you build your credibility as an expert. It&rsquo;s how you tell the story of your products and services. This is the internet! Why are you treating your ecomm site like a Sears catelogue, listing your stuff for sale with a little blurb. Geez! You and 150,000 other sites selling Widget X look all the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the world is changing. Blogging is so last decade. I cannot stress enough on the eve of LaSalleMart3 being released, that those who use LaSalleMart3 e-broadcast. So much so that I have in mind so create a Joomla e-broadcasting platform to work hand-in-glove with my ecommerce. Especially for ecommerce sites &mdash; and especially for the client profile I expect to serve with LaSalleMart3 &mdash; e-broadcast is &ldquo;the new blog&rdquo; and is a m-u-s-t for ecommerce. You have espied my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lasallecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleCast</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until last week, I just had not grasped what this thing called &ldquo;The Joomla Framework&rdquo; really is. I was not paying attention, and I have my hands full with this from-scratch ecommerce technology for the Joomla CMS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week as the Big Debate over the Joomla Framework&rsquo;s open source licensing. Which led me to discover&nbsp;<a href=\"http://framework.joomla.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Joomla Framework</a>. LaSalleMart work slowed so I could dive into the J!FW, and am I ever glad I did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE JOOMLA FRAMEWORK IS MAGNIFICENT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go forth, Dear Reader, and discover the J!FW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The J!FW is technologically topical right now, and magnificently so. It is so far ahead technologically that it is a separate technological entity than the Joomla CMS that we all know and love. Well, except for a tiny little sliver of a sliver of the J!FW that does exist in the Joomla CMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are intriguing and interesting possibilities with the J!FW and LaSalleMart. And, of course, with e-broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a sample J!FW web app that I installed. After the fourth try to get my install to work, it worked (mostly!) &mdash; and immediately I exclaimed &ldquo;aaaahhhhhh yyyeeessss!&rdquo;. Now I Get It!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you to the few persevering and independently minded souls who forged ahead to create this magnificent gift to all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am S-O-L-D completely on the J!FW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The J!FW is a completely new area of learning &mdash; nearly everyday I pursue this journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight I was asked if my LaSalleMart &ldquo;can do ____&rdquo; like Virtuemart. Let me tell you something: for my clients and I, LaSalleMart is ours! We control the whole darn thing completely. WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE WANT!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a hugely liberating fact: it&rsquo;s ours + we can do what we want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No submitting support requests, no playing mother-may-I, no nibbling around core code. LaSalleMart is ours!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, baby, I&rsquo;m gonna confess something to you right here and now: if all you want to do behind the wheel of LaSalleMart is turn off the add-to-cart form to &ldquo;just have a catalogue&rdquo;, then you do not deserve to drive LaSalleMart. Go back whence you came. Pick up your marbles and go home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart will be obviously lacking in features of your usual Mega-PHP-Cart you download from megaphpcart-dot-com, but as I scolded a workshop attendee over a brew, &ldquo;I am developing a cutting edge ecommerce technology from scratch with Joomla 3.2 and FoFv2, and these are the questions you are asking me?&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is designed to scale in the mobile world. Check!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is designed to work with Joomla, exposing the strategic power of Joomla for ecommerce.

Check!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will not take my development group (future tense) much time to scale features into LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve blogged, I will not do so again until I get LM3&prime;s first production release done. It&rsquo;s getting close, and there&rsquo;s a lot of detail work to do.</p>\r\n', 'Meanwhile, the world is changing. Blogging is so last decade.

Yes, LM3 will work with Joomla 3.3 (the revised versioning is also a story for later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first production release is a nice cart package to run a basic clean cart in Joomla. LM3 is designed to further greater ambitions, but laying down the basics in a new innovative form is the imperative for the first production release. And, wow, there are a lot of basics to lay down. Something about being innovative&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week&rsquo;s been especially productive: Canadian PST/GST/HST, wrapping up the cart summary, coupons (managed to sneak in some tweaks sooner than later), tweaked admin product views, and lots of work on the cart. Already refactoring some cart code, after last week refactoring some add-to-cart coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite working hard on an ajax powered cart, I put ajax on the back burner. Frankly, I was getting upset at ajax subverting the Framework on Framework&rsquo;s HMVC. It is more important at this point to understand all that I am setting out to do, so I understand how ajax fits in. The coding structure started to fall into place once I removed the ajax-ness; but, yeah, it necessitated some re-coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew this week that this re-coding would clobber my hope of getting LM3&prime;s first production release done next week.

Glad to see Toronto as a hotbed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlassian is the software code-in-the-cloud infrastructure that I use: BitBucket (Git software repositories), JIRA (issue tracking), and Confluence (<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/lasallemart3/LaSalleMart+3+Knowledge+Base+Home\" target=\"_blank\">public facing knowledge base</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have enjoyed the luxury of not creating JIRA issues and linking BitBucket &ldquo;Smart Commits&rdquo; to these JIRA issues while getting the first production release of LaSalleMart 3 done. However, after keeping a tight linkage for LaSalleMart2, I can tell you that it&rsquo;s much better to have the linkage. Even as a one-person shop bootstrapping software, LaSalleMart3&prime;s codebase is growing, and the linkage is beneficial. Having kept the formal issue tracking, and then letting it go, I am surprised how I&rsquo;d have preferred to have stuck with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to produce code is the &ldquo;MoneyBall&rdquo; of e-value, so Atlassian is critical software development infrastructure. LaSalleMart is about to involve more people than just me, so Atlassian is indispensible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2013/atlassian-road-show-2013-in-toronto-first-hand-lessons\" target=\"_blank\">last year&rsquo;s Toronto Road Show</a>, I really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. This year, I went with a mission: to ask about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo\" target=\"_blank\">Bamboo</a>, their continuous development offering. I did enjoy the opportunity to talk about Bamboo. Subsequently, I learned that Amazon Web Services offers free EC2 instances to new accounts, so this is going to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/2014apr22_atlassian2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/2014apr22_atlassian2-300x225.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:225px; margin:0px 10px 10px 0px; width:300px\" /></a>I am on the right track as the keynote presentation focused on their new &ldquo;Git Essentials&rdquo; offering, which combines JIRA, BitBucket, and Bamboo. I had not known of &ldquo;Git Essentials&rdquo; prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I attended their Toronto Road Show because it gives me a chance to guage Atlassian as a company, to ask questions, to meet people who work for Atlassian. This year there was a big difference: there was a $16 charge to attend. So those attending were serious about using Atlassian or seriously kicking the tires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlassian is clearly for the corporate market. Atlassian is not cheap beyond the first pricing tier, and clearly it is corporations using Atlassian. But, as said in the keynote, Atlassian is made to scale, and that is clearly what I have in mind for LaSalleMart&rsquo;s development. I would not have spent upwards of two years learning Atlassian by using it if I was not bullish &mdash; I need to know it to scale it to underlie software development growth. Let&rsquo;s be honest, learning Atlassian&rsquo;s been a bit of a PITA, so if there wasn&rsquo;t a tremendous future payoff why would I bother. But there is a tremendous future payoff, and as usual I chased the learning by using it before I really had to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you something, if all I had to learn was JIRA right now, then having a long lead-in period to get comfortable with it wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem (and there&rsquo;s a lot I still have to learn, but at least I have the base). But I have an explosion of learning right now that is unbelievable: getting into real continuous development with Bamboo, designing tests that meld well with Bamboo, Laravel, Laravel + WordPress, the new features in the recently released PhpStorm, etc etc etc. The learning gets deeper and deeper! So, having Atlassian under my belt as I do already is big comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I was worried about Atlassian as a company, that was taken care of pretty quickly. Atlassian is growing. 30,000 customers, 800 employees, opening new offices, and new offerings.<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/2014apr22_atlassian1.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/images_original_blog/2014apr22_atlassian1-300x212.png\" style=\"float:right; height:212px; margin:0px 0px 10px 10px; width:300px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were local Atlassian partner companies in attendence &mdash; think of &lsquo;em as resellers &mdash; which is good to know &mdash; I may have training needs later this year. Yes, I am bullish! I&rsquo;m sure this fall LaSalleMart breakout as a start-up.

This, ladies and gentlemen, has had a profound effect on yours truly, who is developing a major Joomla ecommerce technology.

Web designers, start your engines! Intense customer engagement does not come out of a canned template.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart may not be for the end user, but it is for the power user. And it is definitely made for other consultants. Both groups active in&nbsp;advancing the technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, I think mass marketing as a Joomla extension is pretty moot now. LaSalleMart will spread its wings beyond Joomla, so it&rsquo;s going to stay &nbsp;nascent for a little while longer to contemplate selling $19.99/month subscriptions to the multitudes. If it ever does.</p>\r\n', 'Although thoughts of thousands of subscribers paying $19.99 per month dance through my head, I am not mass marketing LaSalleMart.', 'Although thoughts of thousands of subscribers paying $19.99 per month dance through my head, I am not mass marketing LaSalleMart.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/not-mass-marketing-lasallemart', 'corn-flakes1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2014-04-28', '2014-04-28 12:00:00', 1, '2014-04-28 12:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

LaSalleMart is designed so that it is easy to pull the pieces you need into CLI (&ldquo;Comman Line Interface&rdquo; &mdash; sort of an oxymoron&hellip;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, when I realized that the Joomla Framework is an actual Joomla Framework akin to other independent PHP frameworks (like Zend, Cake, Symfony), it looked like it would be even easier to whip up adjunct web apps for LaSalleMart sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I did not anticipate was an aha moment while I was refactoring (read: re-writing) pieces of LaSalleMart earlier this month. To cut to the chase here, the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; was that the way I was (re)writing LaSalleMart lends itself to re-doing LaSalleMart as &ldquo;web services&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is comprised of multiple, small, targeted-scope Joomla components&nbsp;<em>that talk to each other</em>. It has been a journey of discovery putting the right functionality into the right component (not always as obvious as it seems). This is the first time I&rsquo;ve programmed Joomla like this &mdash; ah, but it&rsquo;s terrific! When a component needs something from another component, it asks that component for what it needs. Usually data or template.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the internal LaSalleMart functionality can set the stage for moving LaSalelMart into a &ldquo;web services&rdquo; thing. Where LaSalleMart back-end functions exist in a separate entity &mdash; within an independent PHP framework (Laravel, most likely), which are then called via a URL (like any URL) from Joomla, WordPress, or from something else &mdash; especiall web apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla and WordPress do have one thing in common: they are actually two websites in one. There&rsquo;s the public facing &ldquo;front&rdquo;; and, then there is the private &ldquo;admin&rdquo; that is resides in a sub-folder (Joomla = /administrator/; WordPress = /wp-admin/).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LaSalleMart administrative back-end can realistically reside in a separate software entity completely. The product detail forms, coupon management, order management, etc &mdash; can all exist external to Joomla and WordPress. Front-end views that need a product price, price ranges, quantity restrictions, etc can interrogate the external software via &ldquo;RESTful API&rdquo; for this information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that the bulk of LaSalleMart can exist separate of the &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; software. This opens enormous opportunities. Theoretically, the actual Joomla and WordPress specific front-end programming development is a minimal effort since the bulk of action occurs outside of the front-end. Oh, I talk a brave game, eh! But, the theory is pretty sound; and, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of Quality Time programming in Joomla-Framework-on-Framework recently &mdash; there is something to the theory. Oh, I&rsquo;ve also taken a good look at my own WordPress Genesis-Framework-based theme, on top of my recent WooCommerce engagement (when I took a Good Look at the WC code), and there is something to the theory with WordPress too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fall release of a new Akeeba Framework that is slated to work with Joomla and WordPress (if I am understanding it properly) (called &ldquo;AWF&rdquo;) certainly intrigues me &mdash; especially if it can help with front-end work!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opportunity to create LaSalleMart web apps from this scenario is huge. I see things like whipping up landing page web apps and single product with express checkout web apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we&rsquo;d have Joomla and WordPress and web apps that can be built, theoretically, from varied independent PHP frameworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an independent PHP framework that I will start using:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://laravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel is a framework focusing on web apps. It seems to lend itself well to web apps. It is in its fourth version, has come out of its initial releases with good overall acceptance and adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may have to figure out the Joomla-Laravel integration, and the WordPress-Laravel integrations. Welcome to innovation, without which we could not cope with the universe of mobile devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no manual giving step-by-step instructions on how to use Laravel with Joomla and WordPress &mdash; and for something that will use both! Just like using Joomla 3.0 and the Framework on Framework to achieve specific goals meant diving being the one figuring it out, same with this. Intrepid people who want to join me on this journey, and enjoy the profit potential so derived instead, should contact me about joining my little family of clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel for LaSalleMart using a web services (RESTful API) + native WordPress for e-broadcasting + web apps = YOWZA!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, yes, time to spread our wings!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S.

My clients banding together to bring features to fruition was a fantastic success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My observation is that it is not usual for the user/client community to band together to create software. Usually, it is developers who band together, with a &ldquo;user community&rdquo; orbiting around the controlling group of developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, in my own experience, my clients banding together to create software was a tremendous success. Custom features were created, no single client paid full price, features created were high ROI features, testing quality rose because motivated individuals actually tested (imagine that!). The outcomes were tremendous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I toyed with many ideas, I never really deviated from the idea that LaSalleMart would be developed by my clients banding together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients agree up-front that they are actively involved in LaSalleMart&rsquo;s development, and so we would organize ourselves for that purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients would not be passive consumers of LaSalleMart. No!&nbsp;<strong>My clients will be active producers of LaSalleMart ecommerce technology</strong>. And in so doing,&nbsp;<em>will be able to build value in their e-businesses that they would otherwise not have built.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If technology stood still, if devices customers use did not change, if we were still at the stage where having your own ecomm site was still considered a novelty, then maybe we&rsquo;d not have such an intense need to be in the software creation business. But, that&rsquo;s not the world we live in, and e-businesses that are actively engaged in software creation are going to kick the ass of their competitors who are not so engaged. We need sites that are engaging. We need sites that have high ROI features. And this is Just for starters.j</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software creation is enormously expensive. It sure would be nice if I could create software per client on an a la carte basis. But, the clients that I serve are not in this position. Even monied clients balk at paying for a la carte software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients banding together is a terrific response to the software creation barriers.&nbsp;<em>By sharing costs of software that return high ROI, we create an eco-system for ourselves where we are progressively able to devote more dollars into further high ROI software</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My professional consultancy is itself an innovative response to do something for my clients that is simply not available in the traditional open source projects (free and commercial) they&rsquo;ve been participating in.

Which one is easier on the eyes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing I do know: Joomla changed its versioning&nbsp;<em>again</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla 3.5 was supposed to be&nbsp;<em>THE</em>&nbsp;Joomla 3.x version. Version 3.0, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 were &ldquo;training wheel&rdquo; versions to get the kinks out and do whatever under-the-hood stuff that was to be done. What mattererd was that 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 were all pointing to a terminus called &ldquo;3.5&Prime;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla 3.5 was going to be s-t-a-b-l-e, with all the wonderful-ness that that entailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it has changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I fully understand that all series 3.x Joomla versions will be backwards-compatible, so upgrading will not (should not?) be an issue. Except that v3.3 requires PHP 5.3.10 (if memory serves), which should not provide barriers for my LaSalleMart clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know worries me? That this versioning system will be changed&nbsp;<em>again</em>, and in so doing will negatively impact LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what worries me? That there&rsquo;s an effort to replace the Joomla Platform with elements of the Joomla Framework; and, that ipso facto will violate backwards compatibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what worries me? That the superb Akeeba Framework on Framework is designed to work with the Joomla Platform, not the Joomla Framework, so it will not necessarily intermediate Joomla changes. So introducing elements of the Joomla Framework in future Joomla 3.x versions could really eff up LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just want to direct your attention to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/joomla-dev-cms/9A57dQ8pA_k\" target=\"_blank\">Google Group thread</a>&nbsp;entitled &ldquo;According to new Development Strategy, are we dropping simple upgrades from 3.x to 4.0 ? (aka migration again?)&rdquo;. There are a number of extension developers communicating things&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/joomla-dev-cms/9A57dQ8pA_k/dGhJrER7r-cJ\" target=\"_blank\">like</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d add to Beat&rsquo;s post that smooth upgrades between versions &ndash; even major versions &ndash; is essential to retaining people using Joomla. I have a number of people who just still refuse to upgrade from J1.5 because of the level of effort and the number of things that break. For those that went through the effort of 1.5 to 2.5, they did so on the promise that 3.5 would offer a smooth upgrade (NOT migration) from 2.5. With the 3.4 release strategy announcement, does anyone in this group know if that changes whether 3.5 will provide a smooth upgrade from 2.5 or not?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a large community of, perhaps silent, Joomla users who care more about stability and smooth migration paths than any amount of new features. They are you [sic] non-technical Joomla users who really just want a stable web site for their content (whether business, nonprofit, hobby, personal interest, blog or whatever).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I very much agree with this one. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been following this thread, and a few others, and my sense of insecurity goes up. Really wish this was an open and shut case with dead-balls simple declarative statements like &ldquo;Joomla 3.x series core updates will never break&rdquo;. Oh well, whatever. I thought Joomla was on a terrific track with Joomla 3.5 &ldquo;LTS&rdquo;. Now&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a recent article:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pbwebdev.com/blog/wordpress-trends-vs-joomla-trends\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Trends vs Joomla Trends</a>.&nbsp;The comments are very very good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I can control what I am going to do, so here&rsquo;s my game plan:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current Joomla version is 3.2. LaSalleMart works on 3.2 &mdash; it should, as the bulk of the programming is done on 3.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the time being, Joomla 3.2 is, for my purposes, is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Joomla version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla 3.3 just came out (April 30, 2014).&nbsp; Once I complete LaSalleMart&rsquo;s first production release, I will then test it on Joomla 3.3. If it works; and, if Joomla 3.3 is accepted by the community (as opposed to having post-release caveats/issues), then for my purposes it will be the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Joomla version. I will post when this happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Joomla 3.4 comes out, I will approach it with the same attitude. Based on the promise (premise?) that backwards compatibility is preserved, I expect that no issues will stand in the way as my considering it the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Joomla version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no indication that FOF, which is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;included with Joomla starting with v3.3, will have issues that prevent upgrading. But, FOF may not intermediate Joomla changes that come from the Joomla Framework. There&rsquo;s been a clear statement on this (I&rsquo;m not hunting for it, it&rsquo;s already the wrong side of midnight). It would be ironic if we had to use Akeeba Solo to back up our Joomla 3.x sites!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if it turns out that a Joomla 3.x series is not working for us, then we&rsquo;ll adopt that version of Joomla as our own and support it on our own if need be. This is an advantage of operating my professional consultancy as a Software Development Club. We&rsquo;ll cope. I already have ideas how to handle supporting Joomla solo (helps that I&rsquo;ve experimented with doing my own Joomla distributions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means that Joomla-LaSalleMart sites will be supported for years regardless of the zigs and zags of the Joomla 3 series from this point on.</p>', 'Joomla posted the new versioninghereandhere.\r\n\r\nThis new versioning applies to the Joomla CMS,notto', 'This blog post represents the desire *not* to dump months and months of intensely intense work on building a from-scratch innovative ecommerce technology.

If I wanted to do something, or not do something, then that was up to me. There was no forum, no support ticket, no one to email. It was weird! No more asking permission!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to use foreign key constraints in my MySQL CREATE statements, and I did. What an incredible learning experience, by the way. I thought I would ease my burden by using a GUI database tool. They stunk, so I hand crafted LaSalleMart&rsquo;s entire database &mdash; about 40 tables so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to achieve a lot of things, and &mdash; many times to my surprise &mdash; achieved them. In so doing, I innovated. And am glad I did because I set the stage to bring<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2014/lasallemart-web-apps-and-the-laravel-framework-for-php\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;LaSalleMart to the Laravel Framework</a>&nbsp;&mdash; in part to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2014/wordpress-yes-i-do\" target=\"_blank\">bring LaSalleMart to WordPress</a>&nbsp;(gonna be different than WooCommerce, I guar-an-tee that). Something that I was not contemplating when I started LaSalleMart 3.0, but am very much contemplating it now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point in building the pieces of LaSalleMart I started to feel powerful. It&rsquo;s a feeling that I&rsquo;ve not experienced before, because I&rsquo;ve never built something like LaSalleMart before. It&rsquo;s a great feeling!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided I wanted to add a few extra features now to coupons. So I did. The core code base is mine, so changing whatever in the core needed changing to accomodate my features I just changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients will get a sense of this power. It may take time, but I know the moment will happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the power of YES.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New features becomes an expression of will and resources. No &ldquo;feature voting&rdquo;. No &ldquo;feature request forms&rdquo;. No waiting for Godot for promised features. We are in control. There is no &ldquo;them&rdquo;, just &ldquo;we&rdquo; &mdash; remember the Club!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I am asked &ldquo;can LaSalleMart do X&rdquo;, I always reply: &ldquo;We can do anything we want&rdquo;. &nbsp;We do not need to ask permission, we can just Make It Happen. That&rsquo;s the power of YES. That&rsquo;s the power of creating your own software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You wonder if I had those middle-of-the-night moments where I questioned why I was programming ecomm software from scratch when there&rsquo;s Magento, PrestaCart, and tons of other PHP based ecommerce software. Bet your ass I did! All the time. But, as LaSalleMart started to take shape, and take shape in the way I wanted it to, these moments abated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, it seems idiotic to recreate features that exist in mature feature-rich offerings. But, I got LaSalleMart to a certain point, and it did not look so idiotic anymore. &nbsp;LaSalleMart is real, and offers a tremendous strategic advantage. For you, and for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will design features that are not designed for the mass market, but are designed for our specific needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what I think? I think doing tradition ecommerce sites is sometimes the wrong response to today&rsquo;s mobile devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what I think? I think that it&rsquo;s practically criminal how people squander the strategic advantages of websites when they do their ecommerce sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our own software, with our ability to create our own software, we can explore responses that we&rsquo;d otherwise not contemplate. Technological responses to business opportunities. And do it ahead of everyone else, on our own.</p>\r\n', 'At some point in building the pieces of LaSalleMart I started to feel powerful.

I am doing something I&rsquo;ve not done before: I am specializing in a PHP framework:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/technicalnotes/Laravel\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel</a>. Why? To do web applications. General purpose sites are, in many situations, giving way to functionally specific web application sites. The web apps I do will be based on the Laravel framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a month ago, Joomla announced that is will abandon the explicitly termed Joomla 3.5 &ldquo;Long Term&rdquo; version. In its place, it announced&hellip; nothing. The version policy to replace it was not announced simultaneous to the &ldquo;Long Term&rdquo; abandonment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That non-announcement shook me up viscerally. As I said in my latest&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2014/lasallemart29\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a>,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>Every major Joomla version has obsoleted the Joomla ecommerce extension I specialized in</em>, which has had, shall we say, a negative impact on my growing professional consultancy. The Joomla 3.5 &ldquo;Long Term Version&rdquo; that is upcoming is a critical assurance to me that my family&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>huge investment in developing LaSalleMart will produce ROI</em>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3.0 was built from the ground up, from scratch, with Joomla 3.2 and the superb Akeeba Framework for Joomla. Successfully bringing to fruition the vision of modern Joomla ecommerce, LaSalleMart 3.0 was a labour of months and month and months of tender loving programming. Mere weeks away from its first production release, LaSalleMart 3.0 represents the culmination of a three year journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3.0 represents my confidence, and my commitment, to Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla was moving beautifully towards its version 3.5 &ldquo;Long Term&rdquo; version. Each version 3 release was a concrete step towards the &ldquo;Long Term&rdquo; terminus that LaSalleMart 3.0 would base itself on for two years &mdash; actually, my timeframe was three years although officially the &ldquo;Long Term&rdquo; version would be officially supported for two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The superb Akeeba Framework on Framework was included with Joomla, in Joomla 3.2. further solidifying what was to be a very solid &ldquo;Long Term&rdquo; Joomla 3.5. Although FOF&rsquo;s donation to Joomla has now ceased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abandoning the &ldquo;Long Term&rdquo; Joomla 3.5 brought fear, but not enunciating what would take its place produced a deep visceral reaction from which I never recovered. I did not know it at the time, but that was it for me with Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven years I&rsquo;ve been working with Joomla. Five years involved with the Toronto Joomla Group. Two odd years on its Steering Committee. A podcast mostly devoted to Joomla that won an Honourable Mention at a Joomla conference. A monthly podcast devoted to my Joomla projects. A huge investment in modern Joomla ecommerce. So, yeah, it&rsquo;s a major thing that I am switching technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not having a replacement versioning policy shook my confidence to the core. The replacement policy that was published about two weeks later was dense with text and poorly formatted &mdash; really, you think clients are going to wade through that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have read a lot of threads on different sites about the new versioning policy. None have produced any illumination, nor contributed to restoring my confidence. The repeated claims that the Joomla versioning policy is just like WordPress&rsquo; version policy is bullshit.

But, look, ask around about WordPress&rsquo; codebase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The times are a-changing, and the economics are a-changing too.

Perhaps a meld of CMS and app. A form of Creative Destruction perhaps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Laravel Framework also has a Symfony base. Laravel was born for web application development, and has hit an inflection point, of which I am a part. And you should be a part of it as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a frustrating moment with Laravel when I put my contact page together. For my LaSalleMart.com site, I deleted my Joomla site. I put together a site with Laravel, in part for a real learning experience with Laravel. I was really pissed off at Laravel, because email does not &ldquo;just work&rdquo;. Why, we have to set up the actual email function. Stupid me, I kept thinking I was using Joomla. Just fire up the contact component and that&rsquo;s it. Well, there is no contact component. And there is no email thingee either. So, I set up my contact form, and the email never happened. First was anger, because if Joomla has email &ldquo;just work&rdquo;, then why can&rsquo;t Laravel do such a basic thing? Then, was intense frustration at figuring out the email!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My intense frustration at Laravel&rsquo;s lack of email functionality was the demarcation line of moving from CMS to apps. Web applications are not the same thing. I persisted and figured out how to actually send an email with Laravel. Why, gee, the best way to send an email in Laravel is to use a transactional email service. There are two that come out-of-the-Laravel-box, of which one I am familiar. Oh, how familiar? You want to know the power of blogging? Why, I have a blog post from a year ago on this web service:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2013/new-mandrill-library-for-lasallemart\" target=\"_blank\">New Mandrill Library for LaSallemart</a>. I already have a Mandrill account set up doing absolutely nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandrill signed up its 250,000th user this month. MailChimp, which owns Mandrill, has 6,000,000 users.&nbsp;The thing a</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>You might think most of those 250,000 users come from MailChimp&rsquo;s 6 million users. We thought the same thing! When Mandrill started, we expected a lot of crossover. Turns out the audiences are completely different, and we had to re-think our entire approach. Mandrill&rsquo;s a team that likes challenges though: this one just meant Mandrill had to earn these users on our own.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>(from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.mandrill.com/250000.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://blog.mandrill.com/250000.html</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I got Mandrill to work. I found where to put the Mandrill API, set my email hosting keys with HostGator (this is how I knew I was setting up &ldquo;real&rdquo; email!), and my contact form sent email. And I thought, the power, the magnificent power! Never in my wildest dreams did I contemplate building a MailChimp type app in Joomla. You don&rsquo;t build apps in Joomla! You need serious firepower for such a thing. Even with the superb Akeeba Framework for Joomla, forget it. But, if not build a MailChimp type app that uses Mandrill (hows that for irony, but Mandrill is built upon MailChimp&rsquo;s email &ldquo;engine&rdquo;, at least originally), then build INTEGRATED WORKFLOW that includes transactional email (I am already mulling SMS too).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this type of blog post, I&rsquo;d normally want to enumerate the reasons why apps are so inherently powerful than the CMS. Well, I really don&rsquo;t want to this post. Maybe another time&hellip; it&rsquo;s enough to know that I&rsquo;m spanning new vistas and realizing why the start-up community talks of &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo; and &ldquo;apps&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;content systems&rdquo; and &ldquo;websites&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, my own personal experience is enjoying the nakedness of Laravel. No menu system, no theming, no article handling, no permissions scheme, no administration. Laravel is not a ready made website, where you add-on your own stuff after-the-fact. Laravel is a set of tools with which to make whatever the heck you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what is the website? Whatever you make IS the site. There is nothing else there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a case where you just decide you are not going to use the menus. There are no menus with which to ignore!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which at first is scary. Which did not last long! Now that I am faced with a blank slate, I feel liberated from the awful bloat that has become template frameworks, component creep, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel has&nbsp;queuing. I&rsquo;ve not done it yet, but the significance is that thousands of processes can be done in the background so the site stays fast. If you want tens of thousands of customers on your site &mdash; or millions! &mdash; then you&rsquo;ll want queuing. Laravel is designed for such a load (you also have to ensure you design your Laravel app to properly accommodate such activity &mdash; queueing is not going to happen auto-magically).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of having rss to email, now it&rsquo;s totally feasible to maintain a list within my site (or, perhaps, keep the list in MailChimp and fetch it) and send emails out everytime I publish an article. Built right into the app. Lots of possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have not looked, but what if there was a Laravel app &ldquo;out there somewhere&rdquo; that had the double opt-in form sequence done, had the unsubscribe form and confirmation done, and a few other email list housekeeping things done, in a nice little installable package?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be kind of like having a content system and looking for add-ons? Well, yes, kind of!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Composer</a>&nbsp;is how one would add a mail list package to their Laravel app. Already, there are a number of contact form packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about LaSalleMart 4.0 differently with Laravel than I did with LaSalleMart 3.0 in Joomla. The potential is so much greater; and, app frameworks are different beasts than content systems. Integrating customer management with ecommerce is one possibility. Workflows &mdash; yowza!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there was a way to somehow break LaSalleMart 4.0 into real small installable pieces, to keep sites very lean, and to be more like a framework than an end-use type of software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should &ldquo;product type&rdquo; be a separate package? Or should there be just one &ldquo;product&rdquo; package?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where this is all going is making apps accessible to those who would normally build high-ish end CMS sites. Where you would need $25,000 to build an app, will soon be $5,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start-up power at CMS prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be blogging more about this!</p>\r\n', 'There’s a difference, I am realizing, between programming ecommerce in a content management system, and programming ecommerce as a web application.

(124, 0, NULL, NULL, 'LaSalleMart 4.0: The Approach', 'lasallemart-40-the-approach', '<p>LaSalleMart 4.0 is starting, rightly so, with LaSalleMart 3.0, where I separated the major ecommerce areas into separate components: product, checkout, cart, coupon, orders, etc. These Joomla components talked to each other. Laravel is made for breaking up ecommerce into &ldquo;domains&rdquo;, so I am looking at what I already achieved with an eye to improving it with LM4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means that I am starting LaSalleMart 4.0 just as I started with LaSalleMart 3.0: struggling with the approach. With LM3, I created something I had never done before; nor, had I ever seen before: one extension comprised of multiple small targeted-scope components. So the struggle with LM3 was figuring out how to get from the proof of concept to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; LaSalleMart development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With LaSalleMart 4.0, the struggle is of a very different character: at what point is my field of dreams too idyllic? Maybe, it would be enough to recreate what I achieved with LM3 with my Laravel based LM4 &mdash; why struggle with the approach at all? Let&rsquo;s just get to it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, for one thing, I am unsatisfied with the answer to the question, &ldquo;What is a product?&rdquo;, in LM3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing is the concept of &ldquo;engine&rdquo;. Should there be a checkout &ldquo;engine&rdquo; that determines on-the-fly what the checkout steps should be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fine to be ambitious, but there is this matter of being on the early portion of the Larvel Learning Curve. Why not Keep It SSimple, and dig right into Laravel?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, while surveying the Laravel 4 landscape, I decided to stay on my Field of Dreams more than practicality counsels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are Laravel ecommerce projects. It was studying these projects that convinced me to dream a little ecommerce dream. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes, shall we!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/moltin\" target=\"_blank\">Moltin</a>&nbsp;is strictly a cart &ndash;&gt; WRONG! It is an ecomm API only &ndash;&gt; see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://molt.in/\" target=\"_blank\">http://molt.in</a>. Basically, you send it an array of inputs and it creates a &ldquo;cart&rdquo; in the session &mdash; am I reading this one right? Actually, there&rsquo;s no actual cart &mdash; there&rsquo;s no view where you can actually see the cart. The cart exists in memory only. The rest of it you have to create for yourself. A great reminder to build ecommerce &ldquo;services&rdquo;. A product is just a product_id with a price &mdash; I thought that on the one hand this frees up what the definition of a product is to be whatever you associated with product_id; but, on the other hand, maybe this is a strict definition of a product that there is a product_id and a price, and little else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can get the product name and description from the product table (I almost said #__lmproduct_items table!), but&hellip; when there are attributes, the cart needs to hold the selected attributes. Did the customer select a white, red, or blue t-shirt? LM3 used database tables for the cart, not session variables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an interesting set of ecommerce packages at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cartalyst.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cartalyst</a>. These packages are &ldquo;cart agnostic&rdquo; and are supposed to serve as the basis for building ecommerce apps. Why not just grab these packages and get a head start? Well, I am haunted by two things: not having my own ecommerce technology; and, having my base technology prematurely go obsolete. In this case, it seems tempting to dig into these packages and get a heckuva head start on things. Maybe even be spared the trouble of creating Laravel ecommerce technology from scratch. Well, BTDT. I would rather be a stubborn S.O.B. and stick with LaSalleMart 4.0; and, later, see if Cartalyst provides added value. Here&rsquo;s a case of the app economics change in action: a set of packages that still require development, but provide a huge head start at nominal cost &mdash; that&rsquo;s how I read it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://bundles.laravel.com/bundle/cartify\" target=\"_blank\">Cartify</a>&nbsp;is a Laravel 3 cart. Well, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s for Laravel 3! Here is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/brunogaspar/cartify\" target=\"_blank\">the GitHub repo</a>. Oooh, I like the product definition including attributes:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$item = array(\r\n   &#39;id&#39; =&gt; &#39;sku_123ABC&#39;,\r\n   &#39;qty&#39; =&gt; 1,\r\n   &#39;price&#39; =&gt; 39.95,\r\n   &#39;name&#39; =&gt; &#39;T-Shirt&#39;,\r\n   &#39;options&#39; =&gt; array(\r\n      &#39;size&#39; =&gt; &#39;L&#39;,\r\n      &#39;color&#39; =&gt; &#39;Red&#39;\r\n   )\r\n);\r\n\r\nCartify::cart()-&gt;insert($item);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Crinsane/LaravelShoppingcart\" target=\"_blank\">Crinsane</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Crinsane/LaravelWebshopAdmin\" target=\"_blank\">Crinsane admin</a>. And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/rktaiwala/Shpcart\" target=\"_blank\">ShpCart</a>. Of course, Cashier comes with the now released&nbsp;<a href=\"http://laravel.com/docs/billing\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel 4.2</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s great to have these Laravel carts to look at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am thinking that each product type has its own installable package. If you want to use subscription products, then you have to grab the package with the product tables, admin forms, associated cart and order tables, and whatever other stuff you need. Which I doubt will quite work this way, since order management will be a separate package, so how can a product package update a separate order package? If I could, would I want to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would someone have the patience to click a separate subscription product admin? Product detail forms have been all-in-one forms to accommodate the various product types. I cannot stand these busy all-in-one product detail forms &mdash; they are so confusing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something I did with LaSalleMart 3.0 was let the administration mimic the programming conventions. So, the forms dealt with one database only. In the end it was not so bad, mainly because the product details forms were minimalist and clean. There was one Knowledge Base page for each product details page &mdash; easy to link to from the LM3 admin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had more product forms in LM3, but the forms were small and understandable. Based on this success (you can see LM3 screencasts at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lasallemart.com/lasallemart3\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleMart.com/lasallemart3</a>) I want to step on to my LM4 Field of Dreams and really segregate product types. A base product will have a product_id and product_type. Right now, I think a base product will also have Y/N fields for &ldquo;shipping&rdquo;, &ldquo;downloads&rdquo;, etc &mdash; although I am not sure exactly which tables these definitions should reside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With LM3, I started defining products strictly, manifesting in the decision to not have inventory for product attributes. You buy the product_id, and whatever attributes that are associated with that product_id. If you keep inventory levels for attributes, then the product is of a different product type than a &ldquo;product with attributes&rdquo;. If a client were to ask for inventory for attributes, I had already decided to turn them down; instead, we&rsquo;d have to build the proper product profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big reason for my&nbsp;obstinacy is the spaghetti programming that comes out of it. Can you add inventory? Ok&hellip;. hack hack hack done. Oh, nice, can you add rules if one attribute inventory is zero, then the product is not available for sale&hellip; hack hack hack hack done. Oh good, but I don&rsquo;t keep inventory for all attributes, so can I have both inventory and non-inventory for attributes of the same product? Forget it! Let&rsquo;s do it right with Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I developed the LaSalleMart 3.0 product and cart views right away. But, with LaSalleMart 4.0, creating the UI is not critical to building the product and cart. Sounds weird, but build the functions first, then the UI. This should make development faster &mdash; and build a RESTful cart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As much as I want to dig into Laravel-LM4, I could waste a lot of time with Ready, Shoot, Aim. So, I will mull my approach over a little more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are Laravel based Content Management Systems on the way. Two are OctoberCMS, which is out, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/PongoCMS\" target=\"_blank\">Pongo for Laravel 4</a>, which is in active development. Interesting&nbsp;<a href=\"http://octobercms.com/blog/post/building-a-blog-and-forum\" target=\"_blank\">OctoberCMS screencast here</a>. I should design LaSalleMart 4.0 so it can use either, and whatever else comes out. This&nbsp;<a href=\"http://codecanyon.net/item/laravel-cms-crud-builder-administrator/7194641\" target=\"_blank\">CRUD Builder/CMS/Admin</a>&nbsp;looks interesting. &ldquo;CRUD&rdquo; refers to the database actions &ldquo;Create&rdquo;, &ldquo;Read&rdquo;, &ldquo;Update&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Delete&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>App as CMS is both fascinating and repulsive to me at the same time! I like the idea of having user management, authentication, pages, and menus &ldquo;built-in&rdquo;. But, right now, I do not want to deal with something that is bloated, tries to do too much, and&hellip; well, where the site becomes the CMS first and not &ldquo;the thing that you are building&rdquo;.&nbsp;I still harbour the idea of integrating WordPress as the product front-end with LM4-Laravel, so there&rsquo;s definitely a place/need for CMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be mulling my LaSalleMart 4.0 Field of Dreams a bit more before settling down with Laravel 4.2 and my IDE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'LaSalleMart 4.0 is starting, rightly so, with LaSalleMart 3.0, where I separated the major ecommerce', 'LaSalleMart 4.0 is starting, rightly so, with LaSalleMart 3.0, where I separated the major ecommerce areas into separate components: product, checkout, cart, coupon, orders, etc. These Joomla components talked to each other.

You just do not build your e-business with WordPress. I thought that years ago and I still think that now. The reasons why Joomla was the better platform with which to build ecommerce technology still exist.

For pure blogging and ebroadcasting, I use WordPress myself and have for years.bourne identity soundtrack</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to sell some products, run an ecommerce site as a hobby or as a side business, then, sure, use WordPress. But, if you have ambitions, then no way I would recommend using WordPress for it. Use WordPress as your product front-end &mdash; yes, something to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I absolutely refuse to build my ecommerce technology on WordPress today just as I&rsquo;ve refused years ago. Laravel is the right place for LaSalleMart to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many buyers of WordPress software and services that sellers gravitate to the WordPress marketplace simply because that&rsquo;s where the money is. Hey, you go where the money is, right? Buyers love WordPress because there are millions of dollars of WordPress technologies available for a song. If you want to build the absolute lowest cost website, then WordPress is hard to beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress&rsquo; massive market share has not changed the fact that menus are still not in their own database table. Or that the codebase is ancient. Yes, I see there are &ldquo;intra&rdquo; changes where code changes look like under-the-hood add-ons. Well, I see that there are clever ways a developer can skirt around the WordPress codebase to get some modern goodness whilst fully participating in the lucrative WordPress marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is tempting to just try to carve myself a slice of that WordPress marketplace by creating LaSalleMart for WordPress. But that&rsquo;s just bullshit, because I never saw WordPress as the platform of choice for ecommerce. If I developed LaSalleMart for WordPress, it would be solely to ride WordPress&rsquo; market share.&nbsp; And you know something, I cannot do that. As tempting as it is; well, it seemed tempting, but no way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart was never conceived to be the consumers choice for ecommerce anyways. That&rsquo;s not how I pursued it. I knew full well whilst developing LaSalleMart 3 that it would piss off the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a web designer, not a web developer&rdquo; crowd. Which meant that an army of web designers would not choose LaSalleMart. My reaction: so what! I was not going to worry about reconciling the technical advantages of how I developed LaSalleMart with the &ldquo;hide the technology&rdquo; requirements of technology consumers. WordPress is all about hiding the technology, which is perfectly encapsulated by its auto-update feature that can only be suppressed in the wp-config.php file. Well, that&rsquo;s not the mentality that went into LaSalleMart 3, which was not designed for the feint of heart. However, if you wanted the technology &ldquo;kick&rdquo; that Joomla 3 + FOF offered, LM3 was for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what I love about WooCommerce? It so WordPress-ian! The hooks, the filters. But, oh, the database! I love how it uses posts for transactions and customers. That is precisely how a WordPress ecommerce plugin should operate. That is precisely what you should get with a WordPress ecommerce plugin. What a pure expression of WordPress ecommerce. And I hate it! No normalized customer tables, no normalized order tables, etc etc. Since when do I need to go to Stack Exchange to learn where my orders are in the database?In my eyes, that&rsquo;s the price of being in WordPress ecommerce: you suck it up and live with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can live with the fact that menus are not in their own database tables, because it is a small price to pay for using a kick-ass blogging and e-broadcasting platform. The database makes sense for blogging, which is what it was originally designed for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, despite WordPress&rsquo; massive market share, Laravel is the place to be for ecommerce.

That a challenge with Laravel is not in using it, but in using it properly to build good apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all I wanted to do was put as much of my LaSalleMart 3 code into Laravel, then I&rsquo;d be on my way. But, why use Laravel like that? Why ignore the Laravel Value Proposition? Obviously, LaSalleMart 4 is not about shoving LaSalleMart 3 code someplace to crank out a new software release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed an end-of-school and extended Canada Day mental break. Oh, does that mean that I&rsquo;ve not worked on LaSalleMart 4? Hardly! It means that I stopped prototyped but continued reading and watching videos &mdash; mainly the excellent Laracasts.com videos. The Laracon 2014 videos were just published, so I&rsquo;ve been watching them. As well, I now watch the Laravel on GitHub and so have followed the substantial daily issue posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have especially enjoyed the posts by Laravel&rsquo;s Founder. It is clear who is in charge. One word replies abound: &ldquo;No&rdquo;. And no arguments follow! If you want your pull request accepted you need a compelling reason. It is not what I am used to with Joomla, and let&rsquo;s leave the comparison at that. It is ironic that &ldquo;building community&rdquo; is based on an obvious benevolent dictator. The community is exploding. So there you go. But right now I see huge, and I mean huge, benefit to the Founder protecting his vision of Laravel as it is expressed in version 4. Everyone has their own version of what they want or how to improve it, and the only way they can truly see their own vision in Laravel is by forking it. Or, create a separate package for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the idea of keeping Laravel lean, and then having separate packages &mdash; such as validation packages. There are so many validation packages, I am thinking that what I should really do is do<em>These</em>my own (based on other open source packages, of course!) &mdash; is a pretty good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this idea is so good that the emerging Laravel eco-system that is itself hitting an inflection will become a viable alternative to WordPress for those that want to reach for &ldquo;app power&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, part of the LaSalleMart 4 approach may include offering custom packages. Validation is one. User management is another. More prototyping is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the lines of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been building&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;apps for 5 months&rdquo;, I know I have to use &ldquo;command buses&rdquo; in LaSalleMart 4. Also, a validation&nbsp;<em>layer.&nbsp;</em>These are things that are part and parcel of building good apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I am investing extra time to get a handle (kind of a pun) on these things. The payoff will be huge, one of which is being able to build more features upon the existing code, without disturbing existing code. Well, it&rsquo;s a new way of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know from developing LaSalleMart 3 that there is enough complexity &mdash; or perhaps it&rsquo;s really scope &mdash; to warrant embracing the structure that the Laravel Framework encourages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I watch&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3uV3ngl1Z8g\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip; I am thinking, it does not seem professional learning programming while programming. Shouldn&rsquo;t I be learn first, and then code? What kind of LaSalleMart can I create if I am treating is as a CompSci 201 project?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it is actually the opposite. If you are not learning, then you are being unprofessional. There is no termination point where you can stop learning and then start coding. The learning never stops. Or, as Laracasts.com motto says, &ldquo;Never Stop Learning&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why the Moneyball of e-business is so tough: you are always struggling with software development. But, you know, value is not where it is easy. If it were easy, then everyone would be start-up millionaires. You are always struggling with software development because, in part, the learning never stops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is dawning on me that the IOC container really is the central idea of the Laravel Framework. Dawning on me because I&rsquo;ve not used software like this before, so it is not intuitive. Yes, I read&nbsp;<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html</a>. I am certainly open to using these concepts purely on the basis that for some things in LaSalleMart 3, there has to be a better way of doing these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something that took me by surprise with LaSalleMart 3 was the complexity&nbsp;of the cart. LaSalleMart 3&prime;s cart had its own set of database tables. Totals, taxes, shipping, and coupons were part of the cart. Add payments and some post-processing steps and you&rsquo;d have an order. Tax was a sub-system, not a mere calculation. The cart had to knock on the tax system&rsquo;s door and ask it to go through its algorithm. Same with coupons. Then, when an order was placed, it the same sequence occurred, with additional processing &mdash; such as deleting the cart database records, and creating the order records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My goal is not to create a LaSalleMart 4 that will be the toast of the CompSci faculty lounge. I have to be practical. But &ldquo;Muddy Controllers&rdquo; (@ 26:20) resonates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eqN-rt-D9KQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://laracasts.com/index/event\" target=\"_blank\">https://laracasts.com/index/event</a>&nbsp;dives deep into it. Yes, it resonates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 was mud, but very organized mud thanks to innovations I had never done before with Joomla thanks to the superb Akeeba Framework for Joomla. But, we&rsquo;re not in Joomla anymore, Dorothy. The Laravel Framework opens up modern ways to handle the &ldquo;What happens when a buyer places an order?&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is dawning on me is the concept of inversion. Inversion is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in &ldquo;IoC&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&hellip;in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_call#Main_concepts\">calls into</a>&nbsp;reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the reusable code that calls into the custom, or problem-specific, code.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>(from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is neatly summed up as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Principle\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Hollywood Principle</a>&ldquo;:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Hollywood principle is a software design methodology that takes its name from the clich&eacute; response given to amateurs auditioning in Hollywood: &ldquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t call us, we&rsquo;ll call you</strong>&ldquo;. It is a useful paradigm that assists in the development of code with high cohesion and low coupling that is easier to debug, maintain and test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most beginners are first introduced to programming from a diametrically opposed viewpoint. Programs take control of the running environment and make calls on the underlying system to do their work. A considerable amount of successful software has been developed using the same principles, and indeed many developers need never think there is any other approach. After all, programs with linear flow are generally easy to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As systems increase in complexity, the linear model becomes less maintainable. Consider for example a simple program to bounce a square around a window in your favorite operating system or window manager. The linear approach may work, up to a point. You can keep the moving and drawing code in separate procedures, but soon the logic begins to branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to make this possible is to sacrifice the element of control.&nbsp;<strong>Instead of your program running the system, the system runs your program</strong>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In LaSalleMart 3, the add-to-cart controller was very muddy, despite the fact that I had done a terrific job of organizing it within the Joomla context. There are a number of things that happen when a product is added to the cart, but, boy, those add-to-cart tasks really start piling up.&nbsp;I have no recollection of ever seeing interfaces in a Joomla component; nor any dependency injection as is done in Laravel. Laravel is modern, in part, because it is newer. And, not having delved into frameworks before the Akeeba Framework for Joomla, dependencies is new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding products to the cart represents a number of tasks that have to be done. Placing an order represents even more tasks that have to be done. Executing these tasks in &ldquo;muddy&rdquo; controllers that grew ever-larger started causing problems in LaSalleMart 3. So, I may not be familiar with Inverted Containers and Dependency Injection, but I am certainly softened up to be receptive to these notions!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The notion of representing the individual tasks as events is quite appealing. See the &ldquo;&hellip; building good apps for five months&rdquo; video. That the controller that requests these tasks does not even have to know what these tasks are is weird and appealing at the same time. Weird because it is not intuitive how a task can be accomplished; and, appealing because it helps organize the code better. That developers&nbsp;can actually traverse LaSalleMart 4&prime;s code and understand it without requiring a separate set of documentation &mdash; hey, how good is that! The number beneficiary of this organization will be me, as I will be able to come back to code months after touching it and actually understand what the heck I was doing. Don&rsquo;t laugh &mdash; you ever write down a recipe, then dig it up later only to realize you wrote in some short-hand that made total sense at the time but is now indecipherable. Well, welcome to the club. I comment the heck out of LaSalleMart 3, but for the code itself to be organized to the point of being intuitively understandable &mdash; nirvana!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big payoff of doing it these new ways is the ability to add new tasks easily. How &rsquo;bout notifying the site owner that someone is in checkout (say, via SMS with&nbsp;http://www.twilio.com). Sure is easier to add one more task to the list than cracking open a muddy controller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big payoff is being able to test the tasks, as they are independent creatures that can be tested on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very intriguing payoff is something that I&rsquo;ve not used before: queueing tasks.&nbsp;Tasks are executed&nbsp;in the background, so people are not waiting around for the processing to finish. Queueing is important for high volume web apps. Having proper tasks with which to queue becomes a necessity so queueing is practical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Laracasts.com motto is &ldquo;Netflix for Developers&rdquo;. Right now, I am more like the Netflix tagline&nbsp;&ldquo;you need to get it to get it&rdquo;. I need to make sense of the Laravel jargon by &ldquo;getting it&rdquo;. For me, the &ldquo;it&rdquo; to get is the IoC container &amp; injection: that Laravel controls the app, not the thing I am developing. LaSalleMart is not in control, Laravel is in control. So, let Laravel control! Hey, Laravel, someone just placed an order, so go forth and make that order happen. Very unlike LaSalleMart 3 which would quarterback everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just a journey into The Laravel Framework, but into PHP frameworks. My introduction to PHP frameworks is mostly working with the Akeeba Framework for Joomla, which incorporates ideas from the general PHP framework world. But, it is specifically meant to work with Joomla, so it is very constrained. I took very little notice of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://symfony.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Symfony</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ellislab.com/codeigniter\" target=\"_blank\">CodeIgniter</a>, not to mention ignoring&nbsp;<a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zend</a>. Maybe I should have had a greater interest in at least one of these frameworks before. Working hard with the Akeeba Framework for Joomla, dealing with its particular idiosyncracies which exist mostly to cope with Joomla, has proved a good learning ground for Laravel. Laravel itself is not like other PHP frameworks, so there&rsquo;s new learning to do anyways. Some of Laravel is not so mysterious, as I&rsquo;ve worked with MVC already. So, as I kick myself for not getting into the frameworks earlier, at the same time it does not matter as switching to Laravel involves new learning anyways. Like the quote says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been building good apps for five months!&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you this: I sense my Laravel learning is happening far faster than with my learning Joomla/Akeeba Framework. One reason I am sure is the complete lack of &ldquo;users&rdquo; in the Laravel community, in the sense that &ldquo;users&rdquo; is recognized in Joomla (and WordPress). There is only one Laravel &ldquo;user&rdquo;: the developer. There are no end-users. No one ever claims that Laravel is &ldquo;too technical, and as a &lsquo;regular&rsquo; Laravel user one should not have to deal with Laravel&rsquo;s technicals!&rdquo;. On the contrary, actually. All the learning resources are focused on developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel is unified. The code is obviously under the auspices of one person. Joomla is under the auspices of multiple people/groups of people, which manifests very much in the code. Right now, for me, Laravel being so controlled by one person is very welcome, in part because what it augurs for code stability; and, in part for learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning Laravel is a cottage industry. There is a lot out there devoted to teaching Laravel. The Laracasts videos are an absolute must.&nbsp;That this site (made with Laravel) is viable is a tangible indicator of Laravel&rsquo;s growth. I must be making progress, because I&rsquo;m starting to argue with the videos&nbsp;while I am watching. Acceptance is not an issue with Laravel anymore &mdash; it is accepted. The issue, now, is education. The Laravel community is responding by creating educational resources. Dig in! These resources are hugely effective in my learning Laravel. Including all the code available at GitHub.com, such as the Laravel website sitting in a GitHub repo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having just viewed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9H6pqC5t_A\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Break the Mold&rdquo; talk at Laracon 2014 NYC</a>, I see that the app folder is highly modificable. Seeing it in action, a few lightbulbs went off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there&rsquo;s more videos, more articles, and more learning to do. The IoC container is key, but there are other ideas to absorb. There are a lot of others in the same boat as me, learning the specific Laravel concepts that make it so unique and compelling. Although I wanted to have more LaSalleMart 4 code prototyped in Laravel at this time, my little summer mental break has proved very refreshing and productive, as all the time digging into Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is really helping is having worked hard building a from-scratch, innovative LaSalleMart 3. At every step of my Laravel learning, I am constantly referring to my LaSalleMart 3. There are a lot of people who relate Laravel to their CodeIgniter projects. There are a lot of people who relate Laravel to their Symfony projects. I imagine there are not a lot of people, relatively speaking, coming from Joomla, but that is me. LaSalleMart 3 could probably be better construed as ecommerce for the Akeeba Framework than simply as a Joomla extensions. It is my intensive use of the Akeeba Framework for Joomla that is paying off hugely right now in my transition to Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'As I just posted, I love this quote from the Laracon 2014 NYC session: “I’ve been building apps ', 'As I just posted, I love this quote from the Laracon 2014 NYC session: “I’ve been building apps for 16 years, but I’ve been building good apps for 5 months”...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/lasallemart-4-approach-part-deux', 'approach1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2014-07-03', '2014-07-03 22:37:22', 1, '2014-07-03 22:37:22', 1, NULL, NULL);

The reasoning behind creating my own little CMS is learning + need. I need to develop something smaller than LaSalleMart to really learn Laravel, so why not develop LaSalleCast? Well, LaSalleCast is not exactly un-ambitious, but it is a live project I want to start; and, it is smaller in scope than LaSalleMart. LaSalleCast needs stuff that all Laravel apps seem to need: user management,&nbsp;article management, etc. Well, why not create a CMS that all my projects can use. I can move LaSalleMart.com to it, so I already have my first real site! A CMS has the stuff is the subject of videos, articles, and a lot of GitHub source code, which makes it seem like a great first app to develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing about a CMS is that it is really two separate and distinct apps, separated by a common database. There is &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; that is the website that everyone sees. Then, there is the administrative &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; that only those who run the site see. There is only one database, though, that both share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After moseying around a lot of examples and articles, I am going to explicitly delineate the front and back ends. This is something I&rsquo;ve not seen yet, and is not necessary to do with Laravel, especially with its flexibility with routing. Maybe my problem is that you can take the boy out of Joomla, but you cannot take Joomla out of the boy. &nbsp;Joomla has explicit front and back ends (yes, WordPress too). Separate folders for templates, modules, language files. About the only thing that the front and back ends shared were the libraries and plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hardly imagined when I moved to the Laravel Framework that I would develop a Joomla-ish CMS. Seems a bit ironic, eh! Well, not Joomla-ish, but how about &ldquo;Joomla inspired&rdquo;? Unlike Joomla, the entry point is shared, but from there I will separate the front and back ends with their own folders. Each will have its own layouts (templates/themes), own routes, own MVC, own folders. The database will be shared, and if other things are shared I will put &lsquo;em in a &ldquo;shared&rdquo; folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all the &ldquo;Domain Driven Development&rdquo; and such learning I&rsquo;ve done, it feels almost rebellious to have a main app folder structure of &ldquo;site&rdquo;, &ldquo;admin&rdquo;, and &ldquo;shared&rdquo;. Well, there are two apps in each app, and I am finding that it is quite confusing. Why not put my intense Joomla experience to some good use? Indeed! I am still calling my little CMS &ldquo;LaSalleCMS&rdquo;. But, I&rsquo;ve already nicknamed it &ldquo;JoomLarvel!&rdquo; (removing that last &ldquo;a&rdquo; makes it more readable).</p>\r\n', 'Took a nice little week-ish long side tour of servers, including Laravel’s Homestead, setting up my first DigitalOcean “droplet” cloud server, and digging into nginx...', 'Took a nice little week-ish long side tour of servers, including Laravel’s Homestead, setting up my first DigitalOcean “droplet” cloud server, and digging into nginx...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/joomlarvel', 'aha_kid.png', 1, 0, 0, '2014-07-18', '2014-07-18 12:00:00', 1, '2014-07-18 12:00:00', 1, NULL, NULL),

(135, 0, NULL, NULL, 'Six Months In With New Specialties: A Retrospective', 'six-months-with-new-specialty-a-retrospective1', '<p>It is six months since I decided, in a flash of an instant of a moment, dropped Joomla; and, decided to specialize in the Laravel Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months hence I presented my custom blog app made with Laravel to the Toronto Laravel meet-up group; and, have installed it on four of my own sites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, it&#39;s been a grand achievement these six months. The scope of learning&#39;s been vast. Can I learn new and different technicals at 50? Bet your ass I can. It&#39;s been gratifying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although these six months have been expensive, the years preceeding my switch were lean too. The constant Joomla version changes were absolute disasters, a lesson that is germaine to the upcoming Laravel version.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not once in these six months have I regretted moving from Joomla. Not in the dead of night deep in my own thoughts. Not one shred of doubt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My only doubt, in fact, was not switching to Laravel when I started working on LaSalleMart 3.0.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my estimation, which has not changed one iota since writing about it extensively in my blog and podcasts, is that Joomla is already a niche CMS. Nothing more, nothing less. My regret is not seeing it for what it really was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A guy like me would get neck deep into WordPress, right? That&#39;s where the action is, right? Well, instead, I dove further into development, which I think is a bit unusual. Actually, I&#39;ve been working with WordPress more than ever for clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, ultimately, six months in, it is clear to me that I am interested in picking up where I left off. I now have my own blog app, and I am thrilled about it -- a passion that I know came through at my presentation. I have in the works my LaSalleCast app with which to run my podcasting line of business. I am actively researching developing&nbsp;LaSalleMart 4.0&#39;s API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I am doing is the same. It&#39;s the technology that is different. A more powerful technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I will be doing is keep at what I am doing. Building LaSalleCMS, LaSalleCast, and LaSalleMart. And with it, perhaps a bit of LaSalleCRM and LaSallePM.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But something happened in last month, in October, that has made me decide again on my technology direction. Laravel itself was slated for a gentle release to verion 4.3 this month (November 2014). However, in October, all notions of version 4.3 were blown to smithereens in favour of a new backwards-compatibility breaking version 5.0.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you know something, this course correction, has made me blistering mad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Laravel creators and sponsors can do anything they darn well want with their Framework. It&#39;s their right, it&#39;s their decision. That they said one thing and then changed their mind is their perogative. Further, they can put in whatever feature they want, which is their perogative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These technology version changes are a killer, eh!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m not throwing away a very intense, and many time tense, and hardly costless, six months transition period. And, for the first time in years, I do not see a clear Value Proposition in switching to the new version of what I am using. Furthermore, for the first time, I have the ability to use multiple versions, and multiple frameworks, for my software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October, I decided that my software is more important than the frameworks I use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, I thought it crucial to know all I could about Laravel, in part so I could land programming gigs while developing my own software. Now, I am throwing these notions out the window. Frankly, it&#39;s been liberating, as I&#39;ve stopped worrying about becoming familiar with the latest toys and pop-features that are in vogue. Ironically, I&#39;ve become more proficient with Laravel 4.2 these last two weeks not worrying about keeping up with the latest Laracast videos or worrying about Laravel 5.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My commitment is to my software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel 4.2 is kick-ass. It is not obsolete. It is powerful technology and I am glad I learned it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does it matter that LaSalleCast is based on L4.2 or L5?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my estimation, no. But sticking with L4.2, becoming more proficient with it, makes my software better. And gets my software into production a heckuva lot faster.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, following the decisions made with L5 has increased my understanding of L4.2. Furthermore, I&#39;ve started to look at the framework that underlies Laravel called Symfony, and have gained more insight as a result.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months ago, if you told me that I would build my own blogging app, I&#39;d have laughed at you. But I did. I am getting fearless. The framework stuff is hugely over my head, but so what, I can still clone the repo and change it for my own purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the open source license Joomla and WordPress uses, the open source license Laravel uses is especially compact in its <a href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\" target=\"_blank\">expression of software freedom</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br />\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal<br />\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br />\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br />\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br />\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br />\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>My guess is that L4.2 will be, if it is not already, in &quot;maintenance mode&quot;. It&#39;s seen all the major (and major-minor) features its going to have. So, hacking away at it to suit my own software needs is not going to deprive me of future creature features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So for now, I am going to stick with L4.2. Actually L5 has not been released, so when it is, I will study it. But I am forging ahead with my own software with L4.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, what I have on-deck is creating some packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a database backup package that I want to use as the basis for my own package as I need more functionality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to turn my itty bitty little Access Control code into a separate package, with which to grow into a grander ACL system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may similarly do the same for my image handling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am mulling a package to handle what I will loosely call &quot;Command Bus Handling&quot;. I need a package that will simplify creating &quot;CRUD&quot; in the admin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really want to dive into LaSalleCast development, but it&#39;s clear to me that I&#39;m going to get bogged down if I don&#39;t clean up some things in my blog app first.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With LaSalleCast development, my goal is get operational first. I expect a lot of pet features that I want to build will not happen at first, so that I can get my new LaSalleCast Media site up-and-running by this month-end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will divulge that I am curious if I can actually program a basic email app. Where emails can be sent and received within the app. Where threads can be saved. If so --&nbsp;and I&#39;m sure it is do-able! -- I will have the basis for the kind of CRM and PM (project management) thingee that I&#39;ve been looking for -- and can offer to my clients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ll see... first I have to clean up LaSalleCMS and get out LaSalleCast&#39;s first version....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Six months since changing my technical specialty.

(136, 0, NULL, NULL, 'A Sense of Progression', 'a-sense-of-progression14', '<p>By Halloween I really wanted to have LaSalleCast done to the point where I could at least resume podcasting. Not having even started LaSalleCast upset me deeply. It seems so easy to get sidetracked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve been asking myself what the point of it all is if I can&#39;t get my darned software out the door. The past number of years I&#39;ve been programming, but where&#39;s the software? It really burns me up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a lot of software that I want to produce. LaSalleCMS. LaSalleCast. LaSalleMart. LaSalleProjects. LaSalleCRM?! I need to pick up the pace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you something. I came to a startling conclusion today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve been asking myself for months &quot;Would I hire myself?&quot;. Have my development skills progressed to the point where someone would want to hire me? Do I perceive myself as someone whom I&#39;d hire? I figure if I know I&#39;m at a certain proficiency than I could get some programming gigs&nbsp;while en route to developing my own software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one is a bigger critic than me (so I think!), so naturally I do not think that I would hire myself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I looked at it from a Moneyball perspective. To me, &quot;Moneyball&quot; (yes, referring to the movie -- see previous blog posts) means looking at where value really comes from. From a technical proficiency viewpoint, I am not there yet. From a value perspective, though, I represent huge value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My will to learn is sky high. My ability to learn is huge. I am pushing pushing pushing all the time to learn. What I did to achieve LaSalleMart 3.0 pales to what I&#39;ve achieved in the last six months. Now, I am getting fearless, because six months ago I would never think I would create a blog app from scratch. Now I am thinking of a type of LaSalleFramework for myself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My ambition, my perserverance, my relentless push to learn -- along with a background that encompasses much more than just programming. There is tremendous value there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, after thinking that I am un-hire-able for Laravel gigs, I have concluded that, be that as it may (and yes, my testing skills are, ahem, nascent -- but even here my skills are s-l-o-w-l-y improving), my value to a growing start-up is immense. Solving problems, delving into the unknown, etc etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My startling conclusion: keep this value for my family, instead of transferring it to someone else.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so marks the end of a very short era where I ask myself, &quot;Would I hire myself?&quot;. For a deep techie gig, no. To help build a start-up, yes. My own start-up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so I am truly thinking of myself as a start-up, and less of a programmer. As a start-up, I need my software to come to fruition, otherwise there is no RoI. My need to be proficient in all the latest hot techniques is now superceded by the need to build my software business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which precisely describes where I am at: build my software business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is high time I got my software out-the-door.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need a three-to-four (-to-five) year outlook for my software. I need underlying software that supports a longer term. Which is impossible since software changes over in a shorter timeframe. So the shorter timeframe needs to be manage-able. And, sometimes, change needs to be avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel 4.2, the current version, the version I learned and really like, is not obsolete. It works, the PHP version(s) it uses is new, its modern ways that I found so attractive are still modern.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that if I have to learn a new revamped version of Laravel, then why don&#39;t I put that learning effort into learning something else? There is actually a something else: the framework upon which Laravel is built: the Symfony Framework. Instead of keeping up with the upcoming Laravel 5&#39;s happenings -- and I just turned off my Laravel GitHub notifications today -- I am delving into Symfony.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more I delive into Symfony, the more I understand Laravel. It&#39;s a double payoff. The Symfony documentation is very good.&nbsp;I am reading up on Events in the Components PDF (http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Symfony has a very explicit <a href=\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html\" target=\"_blank\">Road Map</a>. Their change management appears very stated, very measured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I&#39;ll try Symfony&#39;s templating system called Twig. I have a PhpArchitect article about using Twig in Laravel, so I know it&#39;s do-able.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I&#39;ll see if I can use Symfony&#39;s Event system instead of Laravel&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think Laravel 5 is going to have an active post-launch period where it is still subject to change, as a result of mass use. Given how active the GitHub repository is already, IMO there&#39;s going to be an active &quot;settling down&quot; period. So, I&#39;ll see what transpires and assess to what extent I think L5 should be in my software&#39;s future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need to settle down into a prolonged period of software development for the sake of the software business I am building. It is important to actually get software out-the-door -- otherwise, this is all moot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also want to point out that my proficiency in L4.2 is deepening, which is extremely valuable. At this point I&#39;d rather spend my efforts further deepening my L4.2 proficiency because with such proficiency I can get my software out-the-door. And, I can use my deepening skills to broaden my chops -- especially testing and API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting LaSalleCast to a point where I can use it to re-start my podcasting is very important to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I am changing tact in my approach because even more important is finding ways to speed up my development! I have far too much software in mind to build for this pace of development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three areas that I am currently seeking, how do I put it, &quot;boilerplate&quot; solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first area is form processing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second area is form building.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third area is listing records in the Admin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For form processing, I am building my own solution based on Laravel packages I am currently using. These packages are not providing the comprehensive solution I crave, so I am building the solution I crave.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For form building, I will survey what is out there in the hopes that I can jump on an existing canned solution that relieves me from hand-coding forms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For listing records in the Admin, I miss this aspect of the Framework-on-Framework that I used for Joomla. My hope is that I can find a similar solution that builds the sorting and filtering and pagination automatically, akin to FoF. In my preliminary searches, there are packages out there to explore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is to get big chunks of software done in an afternoon, rather than taking days to hand-craft &#39;em. So, I am investing time now to achieve this payoff, at the cost of delaying LaSalleCast. The theory is that the time saved from getting these three areas under my belt will more than offset the delay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may further delay LaSalleCast by building a custom&nbsp;email package. Embedded into LaSalleCast will be a little email app, where I can send and recieve emails within LaSalleCast. The advantage is I can track threads with sponsors and guests right in LaSalleCast. Sending and receiving emails is an important aspect of a ticketing&nbsp;app (or more broadly speaking, CRM), and a project management app. So, I am thinking of building this package ahead of LaSalleCast, to have this essential feature figured out and in my back pocket.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'By Halloween I really wanted to have LaSalleCast done to the point where I can resume podcasting...', 'By Halloween I really wanted to have LaSalleCast done to the point where I could at least resume pod', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/a-sense-of-progression14', '2014oct28_laravelTO_presentation/2014-10-28 20.47.06.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2014-11-08', '2014-11-08 14:42:57', 1, '2014-11-08 16:51:39', 1, NULL, NULL),

Here&#39;s one topic that is conspicuously missing from my blog and podcasts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would such a well known topic so integral to website success be the exact thing that I avoid talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you why: I think that SEO is simultaneously complete and utter bullshit; and, is also sublime. But it&#39;s hard to discuss it out the depths of the bullshit that I am usually engaged in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I think the general public and&nbsp;clients have a bullshit attitude about SEO. Rare is the sublime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think &quot;SEO&quot; is really a code word for &quot;Quick Buck&quot;. Or &quot;Quick Fix&quot;. Or &quot;Game The System&quot;. Or, naturally, &quot;Blame The Consultant&quot;. But the ultimate code word is &quot;Snake Oil&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really do not know which came first: people clamouring for a quick fix to their website ills; or, those who proffer quick fixes. Well, I think the demand comes first. Those who demand quick-and-easy fixes are the reason there are those willing to sell those quick-and-easy fixes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, I&#39;ve frustrated my fair share of clients, and the general kick-the-tires crowd, because I refuse&nbsp;to proffer quick fixes to &quot;The Traffic Problem&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, if you want track-backs, link-backs, link bait -- the whole bag of tricks -- then get yourself another consultant, because I think that stuff is unadultered bullshit. Look, let&#39;s be honest, in my experience, these types of clients are bullshit clients. They go from one consultant to the next, they complain about each invoice, they are moan-and-woers, and the ratio of free-hours-per-billable-charged-hour is on the high side. Really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, you have two choices with SEO: pay Google; or, roll up your sleeves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To which, I must interject here that I believe that before you worry about SEO, you worry about conversion. Conversion is what it is ultimately about, right? Well, the sites I&#39;ve been involved with over the last near-decade, it is about conversion. It is almost all about conversion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m trying a bit of shock therapy here, for a reason. The clients I want to serve are those who (mostly) agree with me about SEO. In separating the wheat from the chaff, I am kicking off my special Client Series with what I think is the most divisive issue surrounding websites. If you are adament that you pump as many &quot;visitors&quot; to your site as you can; that you &quot;drive traffic&quot;; that you &quot;maximize eyeballs&quot; (do people really still say that??), then you are likely not my cup of tea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we talk about c-o-n-v-e-r-s-i-o-n, then we can talk about SEO. But we&#39;ll have to dispense with the bullshit. I mean, you don&#39;t need me for that, do you? There are consultants on all four corners of the globe who are happy to dance the dance and then take your money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it&#39;s not like I think I am the last word on &quot;SEO Truth&quot;. It&#39;s a big SEO world. You want to run-and-gun, go ahead. You do the shake-and-fake without me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have an SEO philosophy: your site needs to be intrinsically worth being on. Google wants you to have a &quot;real&quot; site where &quot;real&quot; people read, watch, download, and buy. You celebrate that. You offer that. You strive for that. It&#39;s hard! No wonder people are attracted to the snake oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have an SEO philosophy:&nbsp;Google wants you to have a REAL site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want my clients to have real sites. Sites that have pathways to conversion. Then, I want my clients&#39; sites to look at SEO, because once you have an intrinsically &quot;real&quot; site, you can start earning Google Love.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have an SEO philosophy: real content is crucial. This is itself controversial, but this is my philosophy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real site with real content -- and fresh content -- is the kind of client site I want.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have an SEO philosophy: long tail keywords are kick-ass. These keywords should be a natural by-product of your content. It should seem natural to have long tail keywords in your article&#39;s title.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I never thought that obsessing about H2 tags, optimal search term sprinkling, and other tricks really meant much. The meta-tags are pretty well a waste of time. Google publishes changes to their algorithms daily (if not more frequently), so what works yesterday is ineffective today. What matters is what endures, and that&#39;s having a real site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building a real site is hard work. And that&#39;s really what separates the wheat from the chaff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Search Engine Optimization.

Great answer (by founder of CodeShip):</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Jenkins/Hudson (OSS) was the most common service in the past. It&#39;s a huge piece of software, very complex with a lot of features and a shitty UI.&nbsp;<strong>Therefore it&#39;s an absolute pain-in-the-ass to set up&nbsp;</strong>[I concur! -Bob]. When the trend towards cloud started, the Jenkins community tried to keep pace and added plugins. However Jenkins/Hudson never developed as a cloud-based CI&amp;CD solution, especially not for the GitHub-IAAS/PAAS stack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various services (mainly startups) have pushed into this space. They all have in common that they are hosted SaaS solutions. Some of them (like hosted-ci.com) are just a hosted Jenkins server, most of them not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CIsimple and Hosted-CI are focusing on mobile development. That means, they just support Android and iOS, but not web applications (eg. Ruby projects).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://circleci.com/\">CircleCI</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.codeship.io/\">Codeship</a>&nbsp;as well as Travis-CI are mainly for web applications. They all support the big frameworks but are different in detail.<br />\r\nWercker is one of the newer services in that space (like many others) but still in beta. I haven&#39;t tried them and I don&#39;t know how their solution looks like.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.codeship.io/2013/06/04/Testing-Tuesday-8-Behavior-Driven-Integration-and-Unit-Testing.html\">http://blog.codeship.io/2013/06/04/Testing-Tuesday-8-Behavior-Driven-Integration-and-Unit-Testing.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-feature-branch\">https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-feature-branch</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/04/practical-continuous-deployment\">http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/04/practical-continuous-deployment</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'There\'s a lot of RoI in Continuous Technology.

So, FoF is a hedge against future changes in the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you program for FoF, you are programming for&nbsp;<em>future</em>&nbsp;Joomla platform changes - to the extent that it is possible to do so. Having lived the brutal best before code expiration of LaSalleMart 1 (for Joomla 1.5) and LaSalleMart 2 (for Joomla 2.5), I am coding LaSalleMart 3 with the confidence that my Joomla ecommerce technology can glide into Joomla 4 (and beyond). As opposed to shelving the whole thing each time there is a new &nbsp;major Joomla version; and, as opposed to requiring deep rewrites to accommodate the new major Joomla version.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF brings out the native strengths of Joomla, compensating for the surprising inability of Joomla itself to bring out these strengths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I applaud Nicholas for baking HMVC into FoF. The &quot;H&quot; is bringing an awesome power to LaSallemart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla is programmed on the &quot;Model View Controller&quot; paradigm. Which is why the folder structure has (wait for it!) &quot;controllers&quot;, &quot;models&quot;, and &quot;views&quot; folders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;H&quot; is &quot;Hierachial&quot;&nbsp;&ndash; no, there is no &quot;hierarchial&quot; folder! The &quot;H&quot; means that one component can use another component&#39;s &quot;MVC&quot;. Peek-a-boo, I see you! Good-bye, monolithic impossibly-bloated components!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;H&quot; means that plugins and modules that need to use a view in a component can actually use that view, instead of recreating that view within the plugin/module. Modules and plugins are so often just a conduit for another component&#39;s view. With FoF, the modules and plugins can fetch the view already existing in a component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;H&quot; is not merely a feature that LaSalleMart 3 uses here-and-there. &quot;H&quot; is not just a mere convenience. &quot;H&quot; is a deeply profound aspect of Joomla programming for LaSalleMart 3. Components, modules, and plugins are designed on purpose to embrace &quot;H&quot;. They are related!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saying that FoF is the &quot;RAD layer&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. &quot;RAD&quot; is &quot;Rapid Application Development&quot;, which is an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/rapid-application-development\">approach to creating software</a>. Don&#39;t really know what you need for the software you want? No problem! Don&#39;t do One Big Project. Just do 100 little complete projects. Call each little complete project &quot;iteration&quot;, and then use the things you created in the last &quot;iteration&quot; as the starting point for the next &quot;iteration&quot;. FoF is &quot;Rapid&quot; for different reasons that have nothing to do with project methodology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF is &quot;Rapid&quot; in the sense that it is faster to program in Joomla with FoF than without using FoF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programming a Joomla component is faster using FoF than not using FoF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me put it to you this way: programming in Joomla without FoF is&nbsp;<em>slower</em>&nbsp;than using FoF!&nbsp;<em>The Joomla drudgery that FoF takes care of auto-magically</em>, you then have to bake into each and every component you create because you are<em>&nbsp;not</em>&nbsp;using FoF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF makes building &amp; maintaining custom Joomla components more attractive. So much so that it changes the &quot;buy versus build&quot; proposition. For the time it takes to configure and customize a third party extension, one might as well have just built a FoF based custom extension. So, not only does Joomla have a zillion add-ons. It now offers a tremendous &quot;custom build&quot; proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/TimPlummer/rapid-application-development-using-akeeba-fof-and-joomla-32\">Rapid Application Development using Akeeba FoF and Joomla 3.2 (Slideshare)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Huge thanks to Nicholas, and deep appreciation to everyone involved with FoF.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/frameworkonframework/e7JdfC4BWFY/BJjD8-waBwQJ\">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/frameworkonframework/e7JdfC4BWFY/BJjD8-waBwQJ</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;What are the preferred naming conventions for controllers, models, tables?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Controllers: Preferred is singular, plural will work<br />\r\nModels: Preferred is plural, singular will work<br />\r\nTables: must be singular&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Google Group:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/frameworkonframework\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/frameworkonframework</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doc:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/akeeba/fof/blob/development/documentation/fof-guide.xml\">https://github.com/akeeba/fof/blob/development/documentation/fof-guide.xml</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Repo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/akeeba/\">https://github.com/akeeba/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Framework on Framework (v2) is Nicholas\' superb Rapid Application Development software to create Joo', 'Framework on Framework (v2) is Nicholas\' superb Rapid Application Development software to create Joo', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/akeeba-framework-on-framework1', 'northshoremountains1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2015-01-19', '2015-01-20 08:31:50', 1, '2015-01-20 08:31:50', 1, NULL, NULL),

I mean, I&#39;m talking about one of those tiered pricing... well, the first 12,000 emails per month Mandrill sends out for you is free. Then, it&#39;s borsht after that. Yeah, what I am saying is there&#39;s this new kick-ass email service by a reputable outfit that is giving the service away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve had my eye on Mandrill for a while. Today, the time came to get to it. Interestingly, the problem is the first LaSalleMart app I am creating. It&#39;s supposed to send out emails&nbsp;&ndash; very important emails.

It&#39;s my opinion that single inheritance is frequently abused to the appoint of being an anti-pattern and multiple inheritance only compounds this problem. You&#39;ll be much better served in most cases by favoring composition over inheritance (be it single or multiple). If you&#39;re still interested in traits and their relationship to interfaces, read on ...</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Let&#39;s start by saying this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be a difficult paradigm to grasp. Just because you&#39;re using classes doesn&#39;t mean your code is Object-Oriented (OO).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To write OO code you need to understand that OOP is really about the capabilities of your objects. You&#39;ve got to think about classes in terms of what they&nbsp;<strong><em>can do</em></strong>&nbsp;instead of what they&nbsp;<strong><em>actually do</em></strong>. This is in stark contrast to traditional procedural programming where the focus is on making a bit of code &quot;do something.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If OOP code is about planning and design, an interface is the blueprint and an object the fully constructed house. Meanwhile, traits are simply a way to help build the house laid out by the blueprint (the interface).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interfaces</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So why should we use interfaces? Quite simply, interfaces make our code less brittle. If you doubt this statement, ask anyone who&#39;s been forced to maintain legacy code that wasn&#39;t written against interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interface is a contract between the programmer and his/her code. The interface says, &quot;As long as you play by my rules you can implement me however you like and I promise I won&#39;t break your other code.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...This approach works great. But maybe a few weeks later you decide you want to use a file-based cache system instead of APC. Now you have to change your controller code because you&#39;ve programmed your controller to work with the functionality of the&nbsp;<code>ApcCacher</code>&nbsp;class rather than to an interface that expresses the capabilities of the&nbsp;<code>ApcCacher</code>&nbsp;class. Let&#39;s say instead of the above you had made the&nbsp;<code>Controller</code>&nbsp;class reliant on a&nbsp;<code>CacherInterface</code>&nbsp;instead of the concrete&nbsp;<code>ApcCacher</code>&nbsp;like so:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>// your controller&#39;s constructor using the interface as a dependency&nbsp;public&nbsp;function __construct(Request $req,&nbsp;Response $resp,&nbsp;CacherInterface $cacher=NULL)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>To go along with that you define your interface like so:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>interface&nbsp;CacherInterface&nbsp;{&nbsp;public&nbsp;function fetch($key);&nbsp;public&nbsp;function store($key, $data);&nbsp;public&nbsp;function&nbsp;delete($key);&nbsp;}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In turn you have both your&nbsp;<code>ApcCacher</code>&nbsp;and your new&nbsp;<code>FileCacher</code>&nbsp;classes implement the&nbsp;<code>CacherInterface</code>&nbsp;and you program your&nbsp;<code>Controller</code>&nbsp;class to use the capabilities required by the interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This example (hopefully) demonstrates how programming to an interface allows you to change the internal implementation of your classes without worrying if the changes will break your other code.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Traits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Traits, on the other hand, are simply a method for re-using code. Interfaces should not be thought of as a mutually exclusive alternative to traits. In fact,&nbsp;<strong><em>creating traits that fulfill the capabilities required by an interface is the ideal use case</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should only use traits when multiple classes share the same functionality (likely dictated by the same interface). There&#39;s no sense in using a trait to provide functionality for a single class: that only obfuscates what the class does and a better design would move the trait&#39;s functionality into the relevant class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the following trait implementation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unknown macro: {code here, goto article to see it}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nA more concrete example: imagine both your&nbsp;<code>FileCacher</code>&nbsp;and your&nbsp;<code>ApcCacher</code>&nbsp;from the interface discussion use the same method to determine whether a cache entry is stale and should be deleted (obviously this isn&#39;t the case in real life,&nbsp;but go with it). You could write a trait and allow both classes to use it to for the common interface requirement.</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>One final word of caution: be careful not to go overboard with traits. Often traits are used as a crutch for poor design when unique class implementations would suffice. You should limit traits to fulfilling interface requirements for best code design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'PHP: Traits vs. Interfaces', 'PHP: Traits vs. Interfaces', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/php-traits-vs-interfaces1', 'northshoremountains1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2015-01-20', '2015-01-20 12:26:12', 1, '2015-01-20 12:26:12', 1, NULL, NULL),

(150, 0, NULL, NULL, '2015 Development Road Map', '2015-development-road-map1', '<p>Although I stated my 2015 Road Map in my January 2015 podcast, I want to re-state it here with updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of my podcast, I had not decided to develop a true API for LaSalleMart, not just an &quot;internal&quot; API. As well, I am releasing this API as FOSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision to develop a true API precipated an unexpected research journey. Between this research, and intense volunteer work that needed to be done (and not expected to repeat this year), January did not see much code production. Well, that&#39;s about to change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How I develop my LaSalleMart API profoundly affects my LaSalleCMS and LaSalleCast development. It is imperative that I progress with LM&#39;s API before proceeding with any other development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My API development represents a profound change in how I program code. Not only will I do more up-front planning; but, for the first time I will do Test Driven Development (TDD). Which may over-state things a bit, but I will be programming in conjunction with unit testing (with PhpUnit).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will refactor (re-write) LaSalleCMS. The centrepiece of this refactoring will be a new LaSalleCMS API. Same with LaSalleCast development. This API development depends on what is learned from LM&#39;s API development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, February&#39;s development will be dominated by LaSalleMart&#39;s API development. I just want to develop a basic, yet workable,&nbsp;ecommerce API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, I want to turn my attention to LaSalleCMS. The reason: LaSalleCMS is the predicate to other development. Unlike LaSalleMart, LaSalleCMS already has a full administrative back-end, and a front-end, both which will be re-worked. And, then, will be available to LaSalleMart and LaSalleCast development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a nice little list of things that LaSalleCMS needs: user management, login management, permissions, tag search, and on and on. I figure that I will release a renewed &quot;version one point oh&quot; LaSalleCMS in March.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a bunch of pieces that I want to build as part of LaSalleCast. Pieces that can be used anywhere, but that I have specific uses for in LaSalleCast. As I&#39;ve mentioned before, a main piece is the email handling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not feel pressured to get LaSalleCast all done by a certain date, primarily as this app is really just for my use. However, I do feel a certain urgency getting the major pieces done, and getting LaSalleCast done to the point where I can migrate my existing Media site to it -- which will be a major effort. So, there&#39;s leeway with LaSalleCast, but it&#39;s something I want sooner than later. Otherwise, I could end the year with LaSalleCast and my new Media site not done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With LaSalleMart&#39;s basic API done, and with LaSalleCMS v2.0 released (which will likely be completely FOSS&#39;d), I can then turn my attention to LaSalleMart&#39;s administrative back-end. Before this development is complete, I plan on seeking client sponsorship for this development, and for the first front-end development effort. As well, I plan on seeking client sponsorship on further LaSalleMart API development, as well as building a front-end LaSalleMart&nbsp;site. There will be plenty of LaSalleCMS resources to use at this point, and I plan on adding some hooks into LaSalleCMS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>To Summarize...</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>basic, but workable, LaSalleMart ecommerce API done by end of February (we&#39;ll see!);</li>\r\n	<li>fully refactored LaSalleCMS 2.0, including new API, and revamped administrative back-end by end of March;</li>\r\n	<li>all my sites, except my Media site, converted to LaSalleCMS 2.0 by end of March (they are already using v1);</li>\r\n	<li>start LaSalleCMS administrative back-end in April;</li>\r\n	<li>start LaSalleCast&#39;s email feature, and other major features, in April;</li>\r\n	<li>finish LaSalleCast&#39;s API, and administrative back-end, by June;</li>\r\n	<li>build new Media site during the summer;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Laravel 5</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had serious reservations about Laravel 5, to the point where I decided I better just stick with the wonderful Laravel 4.2 for my Software Trio&#39;s ongoing development. And, to the point where I decided I should learn about the framework Laravel is based on -- Symfony Framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, Laravel 5&#39;s development changed course. So much so that the excitement I had for Laravel back in May when I dove into it has returned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel 5 is looking mighty good, and is on the verge of being released as beta. Probably now it is ok to use, as it is unofficially beta now. But, once bitten, twice shy, with Laravel alpha software. I&#39;ll have to overcome my reticence, as the time to learn it has arrived.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All my development will be done in Laravel 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is up for deep refactoring, so moving to L5 is just a part of this refactoring. LaSalleMart and LaSalleCast development has not begun, so there are no barriers to using L5.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think there&#39;s just one package I&#39;ll need to upgrade -- my database backup package. I might just refactor it anyways, for use with the new L5 &quot;CRON&quot; feature (is that what it is called?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before my nasty and prolonged flu hammered me, I was working on a fork of Jeffrey Way&#39;s Command Bus package. I wanted a nice little plain vanilla command bus package. Well, I can toss all that work overboard as L5 has its own implementation of the command bus; and, as well, has new event handling. I need to deep dive into this aspect of L5, and am glad I messed with the command bus package which helped me learn what it was all about. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>APIARY.IO</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I discovered this month (January 2015) that there&#39;s a lot of tools out there for API development.

You start with your base&nbsp;app, and then you can install add-ons (aka &quot;packages&quot;).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, knowing how exactly I will go about doing my packages in Laravel 5 is an important thing. Which is why I spent some time figuring it out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution I came up with is like the &quot;workbench&quot; facility. The package resides in its own folder separate from the app; and, separate from the &quot;vendor&quot; folder. The package has its own git repository in its root folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it is possible to develop&nbsp;the package within a L5&nbsp;app -- very important! -- and not worry about composer updates over-writing dev files.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I suspect that my package development set-up is made possible by PSR-4 in the app&#39;s composer.json, a new thing in L5; and, likely, the main reason why &quot;workbench&quot; was scrapped.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, first I installed the L5 app as usual.

I do have knowledge bases on my sites, but even then it&#39;s a bit frustrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I am trying something new:&nbsp;I am creating repositories on GitHub.com so I can use its issue tracker. I am keeping my notes and stuff in the issue tracker.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to make this stuff public, so you can see the progression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boy, there&#39;s a lot of stuff already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New GitHub.com Organizations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I created new GitHub organizations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lasallecms\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleCMS</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lasallemart\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleMart</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lasallecast\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleCast</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lasallecrm\" target=\"_blank\">LaSalleCRM</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Repos for my L5 packages and apps will reside here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I already created issues for research nuggets in CMS, and will do so for the other orgs as the need arises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>LaSalleCRM</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My Software Trio has a new addition -- I should now call it &quot;Software Quartet&quot;?: LaSalleCRM.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although developing customer relationship management software is low priority, there is a piece that I want to build into it immediately. A small piece, but a piece nonetheless. Hence, my creating LaSalleCRM.com and the GitHub organization now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>LaSalleMart hooks into LaSalleCMS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a couple of ecommerce hooks I want to build into my CMS right now. Not a whole lot, but this is how it starts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 for Joomla had a unique integration with native Joomla content articles, so LM3 could use Joomla itself for the front-end. In the same way, I want my CMS to power the ecommerce front-end -- why build a separate ecomm front-end system that overlaps LaSalleCMS?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a small thing, but... I will allow multiple CMS categories per CMS post. Then, we can set up a &quot;Product Category&quot; category, with a category tree structure underneath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another small thing, that presents an interesting challenge (to me, probably not to you), is including a &quot;product_id&quot; field in the CMS&#39; article database table.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I progress, I can build in more hooks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>API</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I am enamoured with the idea of having real API&#39;s for my Software Quartet, logistically it may be too ambitious; plus, the need is not there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each site will have its own API; and, *not* access a remotely located API. The idea is that the store reside at https://store.com; and, its&nbsp;API reside https://api.store.com.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am contemplating putting this setup on hold, and just putting the API within the actual app, but in its own namespace. In this way, I can build the API as a separate package, which I still want to do; but, dispense with worrying about authentication, throttling (that&#39;s what it&#39;s called?), and other worries a true SaaS API have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Update: newly released Laravel 5, updates to my GitHub repos, and more...', 'Update: newly released Laravel 5, updates to my GitHub repos, and more...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/update-early-february-20151', 'update3.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2015-02-08', '2015-02-09 05:28:44', 1, '2015-02-09 05:55:57', 1, NULL, NULL),

Why have each &quot;component&quot; describe its own people -- and therefore create a stovepipe database. No!&nbsp;Why not extract the customer tables into its own package right away? Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing, and placing that package into its own major class of software: customer&nbsp;management.

Going down memory lane, my Tienda add-ons ended up in a full &quot;distribution&quot; package; with the tapering off of Tienda development, I forked it. Then Joomla went to a newer non-backwards-compatible version so I threw out my fork and started a brand new fork. When I released that fork -- and a huge effort that was, I had to threw it out as Joomla went to another newer non-backwards-compatible version. Then, I started a completely new LaSalleMart for Joomla from scratch. When Joomla mis-managed its versioning policy announcement, opening up the possibility that my latest massive LaSalleMart undertaking might end up prematurely obsolete, I dumped Joomla. This was March-April 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To where? I&#39;ll tell you this, something that is critically significant: I did not look at specializing in other content systems. Instead, I looked at becoming a <em>web application developer</em>. Which is how I decided to specialize in the Laravel Framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Most Code&nbsp;Learning Since I Graduated the University of Toronto</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning web application development and the Laravel Framework entailed the most concentrated period of computer learning since I graduated university. And it is still happening --&nbsp;likely a permanent feature of my professional existence. Not just Laravel, but a growing body of topics to dig into. LaraCasts was&nbsp;heaven sent!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>LaSalle Software: Bridging the Gap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It did not take long to notice a huge problem. To build web applications for myself and for my clients, there was no ready-made quick-launch software for us to hit the ground running. Laravel itself is not an app -- it is the framework that powers the app, but is not the app itself. There&#39;s no ready-made admin piece, nor blogging/article piece, nor any of the other pieces that each web app will need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, there were a lot of people spinning up&nbsp;their own web app &quot;starter kit&quot;, but none out there appealed to me. Most were learning exercises, some were more serious efforts but very custom. Plus, I was gun-shy about using someone else&#39;s scaffolding software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed that anyone learning Laravel started out by coding a blog web app. I am no different. It was&nbsp;his learning exercise became a real software development effort to created the web app quick-start software that I - and my clients -- need. Basically, I just kept going.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happened along the way was Laravel released version 5. At the same time, I realized I made a huge mistake not breaking up my web app into a series of inter-related packages. So, I took my L4.2 code as the&nbsp;springboard to creating L5.1 packages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I released three suites of packages: LaSalleCMS, LaSalleCRM, and LaSalleCAST. There is one LaSalle Flagship web app just to get our web apps going; 8 CMS packages; 4 CRM packages; and, 4 CAST packages. Moving to L5.1; and, breaking up my software into related packages was smart move.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>I Am My Own First Client</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way, I had my own web application needs; plus, I wanted to use my own software as a way to ensure that it worked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to replace my existing WordPress sites, especially my Media site as I have a long-standing list of pet features I&#39;ve always wanted. Why not use my new blogging software for my blogging site? And, as well, I could really use a little Knowledge Base app, a little To Do app, and a minimal type of base customer management web app. And, of course, always on the back of my mind is starting LaSalleMart anew.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh boy, did this expand the scope, and timeframe, of what I was doing. More than I ever anticipated. Getting LaSalleCAST done, alone with my Media site web app, took somewhere in the neighbourhood of forever. LaSalleCAST necessitated a working LaSalleCMS and a working LaSalleCRM. So what I have now is an <em>integrated solution</em>&nbsp;that would not otherwise exist had I not pursued my own needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I came across an irritating problem: it took too much time and effort -- and repetition -- to create the admin forms. To create the admin input forms for my To Do, it took forever. Never mind that clients would be irritated, I was irritated! Taking days to spin up the admin basics was not acceptable. I created my own solution: admin form automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Administrative Form Automation: Hours Instead of Days</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of hand-crafting admin input forms, I found a way to set up a handful of files only; and, then the admin forms generate automatically. Now it takes hours instead of days to spin up the admin side. If you or me want to prototype something, it is possible to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing I&#39;ve found, though: it takes a lot of thinking to set-up the database tables that underlie the forms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Commitment to Long Term Development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My wife and children and I have invested enormously in LaSalle Software. We are committed to its long term growth and development. It took an enormous effort to get to today&#39;s historic launches -- we did it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software Version 1.0 lays the foundation for long term development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s no funny business with how I used the Laravel Framework. I stayed within the spirit and practices espoused in Laracasts, so anyone familiar with Laravel will recognize what I&#39;m doing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only with my admin form automation did I &quot;go on my own&quot;. The reason is that in this one area I had to innovate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Bob Bloom</p>', 'Welcome to my LaSalle Software Version 1.0 release; and, to my six web applications based on my Software.', 'Welcome to my LaSalle Software Version 1.0 release; and, to my six web applications based on my Software.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/welcome-to-lasalle-software-and-my-own-web-applications', 'IMG_1343.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2015-11-03', '2015-11-03 23:32:49', 1, '2015-11-18 20:09:43', 1, NULL, NULL),

Each tutorial ran&nbsp;three hours. It was a shame that I could not attend all the tutorials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course I was going to the <a href=\"http://lumen.laravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lumen</a> tutorial. Lumen is the Laravel Framework&#39;s microframework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went to&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org\" target=\"_blank\">Composer</a> tutorial to solidify my&nbsp;knowledge of this core technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the morning&#39;s Composer tutorial started, one of the conference organizers read the riot act about the Conference&#39;s <a href=\"http://confcodeofconduct.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Code of Conduct</a>. As dire as it sounded, in the three days, I did not hear of any incidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, what I thought would happen was hearing laptops and mobile devices during the talks.&nbsp;Everyone had their laptops open, and had their devices on during all the talks. But it did not happen.&nbsp;The ring tones et al were muted, without a word being said by any speaker to mute devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Composer tutorial was superb. The speaker was very prepared for the rigours of a three hour tutorial. He had a lot of slides prepared. A&nbsp;lot of ground was covered. I thought there would be hands-on exercises, but there were none, which turned into a good thing given the wide scope the tutorial covered. As well, the slides had a lot of code, so we saw Composer in action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some Laravel artisan commands launch Composer; and, the Laravel app&#39;s composer.json launches artisan commands. This tutorial helped me understand those&nbsp;processes better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lumen tutorial was hands-on, and required some experience with the Laravel Framework. Some attendees were frustrated not having worked&nbsp;with Laravel before, so they walked out. Those that stayed contributed to a very interactive,&nbsp;lively tutorial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lumen tutorial was the only Laravel specific talk of the Conference. So I think some attendees were expecting a Laravel overview first, before the deep dive into Lumen.&nbsp;It&#39;s great to see people show up for a hands-on introduction to Laravel. So I talked to one of the organizers about doing a Lightening Talk intro at an upcoming GTA PHP meet-up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.southlasalle.com/images/2015nov05_true_north_php_conference/IMG_0995.JPG\"><img alt=\"API (Batman) Tool Belt\" src=\"https://www.southlasalle.com/images/2015nov05_true_north_php_conference/IMG_0995_350x261.JPG\" style=\"float:left; height:261px; margin-right:10px; width:350px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conference Day One:&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Incredibly, I did not take a pic on day one, so this pic is from Day Two. On Day One, I attended:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* opening keynote address<br />\r\n* security top ten<br />\r\n* job queues<br />\r\n* MySQL 5.7 + json<br />\r\n* tech writing primer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the speakers at the Conference&nbsp;were hugely knowledgeable. They&nbsp;did a great job packing a lot of material&nbsp;into an hour.&nbsp;But an hour seemed too condensed a timeframe. The speakers were very organized, traversing&nbsp;a lot of technical ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stayed for the Microsoft Azure hackathon, but did not touch Azure at all (the Microsoft Azure specialist did forgive me). Instead, I lounged around, and worked on a problem I discovered with LaSalle Software, because it was such a great environment to do my own little hackathon. I did follow the real-time Azure example, which was good since I did not attend the Azure talk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.southlasalle.com/images/2015nov05_true_north_php_conference/IMG_0996.JPG\"><img alt=\"XDebug talk\" src=\"https://www.southlasalle.com/images/2015nov05_true_north_php_conference/IMG_0996_350x261.JPG\" style=\"float:left; height:261px; margin-right:10px; width:350px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conference Day Two</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I missed the keynote, due to domestic chauffeuring duties. I was there for the rest of the day:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* great API&#39;s<br />\r\n* API (Batman) utility belt<br />\r\n* debugging<br />\r\n* simple design<br />\r\n* PHP5.5 promises and generators</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I attended the API talks specifically for insights that will help LaSalleMart. I was not disappointed, especially about API versioning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confession: I&#39;ve always been in awe of xdebug. That someone could create such a thing, and that they would release it for free, just blows me away. The author of xdebug gave the debug talk, and it was great.

This series won&#39;t happen for now, so I want to devote brief attention to the topics most on my mind right now in this single post.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Value Proposition of web applications: Software Creation is Power</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What underlies the value of websites? Is it the design? Is it page views? Is it Google search rank?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For the clients I&#39;ve served since going freelance in 2007, value is really rooted in the ability to to create software.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, I&#39;ll tell you this: <strong>the clients who I&#39;ve succeeded with the best have a software development mindset</strong>, whether they realized it or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.southlasalle.com/software-creation-is-power\" target=\"_blank\">The ability to create software is powerful</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where does value come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the movie &quot;Moneyball&quot;, the question was: where do runs come from? The answer was: they come from getting on base. So, the way to look at baseball hitters was: do they get on base? What they conveyed in the movie was getting on base from inducing base-on-balls was just as important a factor as an ability to hit. In fact, the under-valued aspect of a player was his ability to get on base via base-on-balls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;moneyball&quot; of our websites is the ability to create code that brings in revenue. Perahps I should amend that to say that the &quot;money&quot; is the ability to create extra code taht brings in extra revenue(?).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, the majority of clients I&#39;ve served since 2007 do not give a shit about creating code. They want a website. If there&#39;s something they need specific to their business, then somehow it just conjures up magically. Back here in RealVille,&nbsp;it does not work that way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Value Proposition of LaSalle Software</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The clients I want to serve are those who want an alternative to Joomla and WordPress sites -- just as I&#39;ve transitioned out of consulting with these technologies and moved into web app consulting. Like me, you realize that you need to get into something else now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are fabulous technologies driving down the price of getting into, and maintaining, web applications. The problem, though, is that there is a vast gap connecting you to this technology. That connection is always left to the web app owner to create -- the user management, the login management, the content handling, the admin, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is this&nbsp;expensive investment in &quot;scaffolding&quot;, provided to you for free, that you need, so I can get you into your own web apps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is also the basis for your own custom web app software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is also the basis for you to install&nbsp;other installable packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software offers a secondary value proposition, strictly because I need this for myself: spin up administrative database forms fast. Hand crafting these forms takes forever!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For myself, LaSalle Software is fulfilling its raison d&#39;etre.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Web Applications are not for the faint of heart</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is absolutely no way you can escape all of &quot;the technicals&quot; of web applications. The web applications industry is not in its&nbsp;&quot;consumer friendly&quot; era right now. Things are just a bit too nascent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;upstream&quot; infrastructure phase is behind us now. The economics of web app infrastructure has changed massively over the last few years, with the cost of web app infrastructure nose diving -- and the speed of spinning up this infrastructure has increased geometrically.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are in the &quot;downstream&quot; phase of web applications now. Lots of progress&nbsp;about the web application itself -- but mostly it stops at the web app code. It&#39;s not consumer oriented at all. Shielding the &quot;end user&quot; from the technology is impossible, because such shielding does not exist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing web applications means there will be technical things to do with along the way. I want the technicals to be as painless as possible (for the both of us!); however, I can&#39;t shield you from all the technicals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are things that clients do when they are resistant to things technical: they get angry, they become unresponsive, they become victims. People do a lot of things to convey their resistance, but most of all they adopt a &quot;technology consumer&quot; mien.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear client: with web applications, you are part of the software development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Subscriptions for web applications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not shared hosting anymore. I do web applications using the &quot;Best Practices&quot; that the Laravel World espouses, which means you using:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>GitHub.com <a href=\"https://github.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">private</a> software repositories ($7+ usd per month)</li>\r\n	<li>the Laravel Forge service for setting up and maintaining cloud servers ($10 to $20&nbsp;usd per month)</li>\r\n	<li>Digital Ocean cloud servers ($10+ usd per month)</li>\r\n	<li>possibly, for email, Google Apps ($5 usd per domain per month) OR the just launched AWS WorkMail ($4usd/user/month)</li>\r\n	<li>Comodo PositiveSSL certificates ($9 usd per year) (more expensive SSL certs are ok) ==&gt; believe it or not, maybe free!</li>\r\n	<li>Domain registrar separate from email and site hosting</li>\r\n	<li>Mandrill.com transactional email (first 2,000 emails free)</li>\r\n	<li>Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (AWS S3)</li>\r\n	<li>Ottomatik.io backups ($10+ usd/month)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When the time comes, there&#39;s&nbsp;twilio.com, pusher.com, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>I am under no illusions about LaSalle Software</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I started LaSalle Software as a pedagogical exercise to learn the Laravel Framework. Just like most people who learn Laravel, my first app was a blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While learning, I was looking for a &quot;real&quot; Laravel based content system to use for myself and for my clients. Well, I couldn&#39;t find such a system that I was happy with, and I was building out my little blog-y thing-y until I decided that my own blog would become my &quot;real&quot; content system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is just at Version 1.0. You don&#39;t have to tell me what it is missing. Or that it lacks polish (look mom, no javascript!). Or that there is &quot;no community&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am using my own software every day now -- and I mean every day -- and I have managed to infuriate myself by not putting in a few little creature features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually have to remind myself that if I had found something &quot;out there&quot;, then I&#39;d not have had to build my own thing. That is where the industry is at right now. Not to get into a discussion about it, but just to let you know, I was digging pretty deep with Grav and OctoberCMS, and eagerly awaiting Drupal 8 -- I should tell you about it at some point, but I don&#39;t want to get sidetracked right now...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big picture proposition of LaSalle Software -- this, I have delivered! Not only did it get me into web applications, but it got me into it in a way that I could make for myself in a timely way my own custom web apps. There a bunch of tiny little web apps, but there&#39;s a big web app that I had my heart set on: doing my own podcasting web app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An app based on installable podcasting packages, that in turn are installed on top of the base LaSalleCMS packages. I spent a disproportionate amount of time and effort on the templating for SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com, which in itself is a case study. But no way I could do SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com without myself having LaSalleCMS (and LaSalleCRM to a much smaller degree) in my back pocket.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&#39;m not going to blow smoke up your ass to over-sell my software.It fulfills it&#39;s prime value proposition, for which I did it in the first place. I know, because I&#39;m &quot;dog-fooding&quot; my LaSalle Software daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I know that right now there is no LaSalle ecommerce, or LaSalle event handling, or a lot of other packages that are sure to be needed. Well, we&#39;ll create the software ourselves, use a SaaS (eg, EventBrite.com), see what is out there that we can install/adapt for ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You have to really understand your web application&nbsp;to really make it work.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The days of relying on your visitors to intiate site traversal are long gone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It matters a great deal how people interact with your site on all the different mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does not take much to cause site visitors to abandon a site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to <em>really</em> understand your site. Otherwise, people will visit your site, but they will abandon it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For my own podcasting site that I did from scratch using my own LaSalle Software, the number one thing that irritated me was deleting stuff off my site. There&#39;s not a lot of room on a smartphone, so the podcasts have to be the focus. And the clutter and distractions -- extra links, menus, sidebars -- had to go. It is not easy to toss the distractions and clutter overboard!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'There are topics that I want to write about in a series of posts geared just for current and potential clients.

Having just released version one of my software based on Laravel, I am here today to guage if the Chamber of Commerce is a good way to find clients. Thank you, that&#39;s my shpiel&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the key to the fifteen second elevator pitch is to have sixty seconds, and then do it in twenty seconds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must&#39;ve mentioned something about WordPress, because a very nice gentleman introduced himself and then related his frustrations with WordPress. After engaging me in conversation, I&nbsp;suspect that the problem may be with the consultant-client relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another very nice gentlemen, unbeknownst to me, was taking in our chit-chat, and posited a variant on a classic WordPress scenario afterwards. He was more successful in eliciting comments from me, than I was in eliciting details of his situation from him -- he definitely wanted &quot;grist for the mill&quot; about something. My sense was that this was not a frustration with consultants, as our chit-chat was technology focused.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was surprised at my reticence in seeking local clients, despite this being an event specifically about seeking local clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember when I first started deep-diving into Laravel, and responded to a call for a Joomla consultant with the idea that I could &quot;do Joomla&quot; while learning&nbsp;Laravel, and the greater world of web applications. So, I eventually drove to their office, and was asked umpteen questions about Joomla. Then, after being pumped for info, I was then dumped -- did not even hear back from them. For me, this is a typcial local client experience: where the &quot;sales cycle&quot; is used to get free consulting -- while I spend considerable time in the &quot;sales cycle&quot;, and even visit the &quot;client&quot; site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I definitely have a chip on my shoulder about this, except that it is much bigger with Laravel and LaSalle Software because our investment in it is gargantuan -- and the software is released as FOSS. I certainly felt this chip on my shoulder, which is not the best frame of mind with which to shmooze with potential clients, eh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a few other mini-discussions, and in most of them, I said that the cost of web applications have fallen like a stone in the last few years, making this technology more accessible today. The body language on this point was very strong, and this is something I need to continue communicating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This morning&#39;s breakfast networking meet-up helped me enunciate what I am really looking for, and it is really about. I will get into this in my upcoming December&#39;s&nbsp;The Bob Bloom Show podcast; and probably in future blog posts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'This morning I attended my first ever Richmond Hill Chamber of Commerce event -- a breakfast networking shmoozing event at the Richmond Hill Main Library.

Sure, I had brought my Software to a version one release, quite an achievement. But, it had never been deployed on a live cloud server. The deployment process itself was completely new and so much more involved than anything I had done. Hey, never mind deploying my own web apps based on my v1.0 Software -- just building my six web apps with LaSalle Software was a brand new experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward three months:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>my own live web applications work fine on the cloud servers;</li>\r\n	<li>the deployment process works smoothly;</li>\r\n	<li>I fixed things in my own software that irritated me, such as adding a &quot;save-and-continue-editing&quot; button in my create/edit forms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>What I could not possibly know when I released v1.0, I now know&nbsp;for v1.01.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am thrillled to be at this point, to be able to now offer my clients LaSalle Software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original intent of LaSalle Software was for my family to make a key investment for our clients, to enable our clients to get into web applications. I would build &quot;scaffolding software&quot;, and just give it away, in return for enabling an entirely new class of clients, who would otherwise build WordPress sites, to get into web applications instead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web application technology has come a long way. Getting into web applications is more accessible than ever. It&#39;s almost to the point where a high-ish end WordPress site can build a web application instead. The way I saw it, a huge barrier remained: the basic scaffolding -- a basic ready-to-go content system with user management and an admin back-end. I just could not find the scaffolding that felt right for me, and for my clients. So I decided to build my own, as free open source software (FOSS).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scaffolding software means that there&#39;s just enough of the critical functions to get us going. It is not full fledged software, but just enough to get my clients over the hump, into web applications. Otherwise, a&nbsp;client starting from scratch would have to ante up&nbsp;$25,000 to bootstrap the essential software, just to get to the starting point of their actual web application. A client paying that kind of money for scaffolding is not going to release it as FOSS, so each client would have to start from scratch. So, we would basically provide that initial investment to our clients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What ended up happening is that, my guess, we invested an equivalent of somewhere&nbsp;between $100,000 to $200,000 initial investment to our clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was only sometime last month that I stopped calling my Software &quot;scaffolding&quot;. It passed that point, and is really full fledged software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I come from deep Joomla and WordPress experience. My experiences with these content systems, and my experiences with clients using these content systems, have come into play whilst developing LaSalle Software. My intention was/is solidly <em>not</em> to recreate either content system. Why? Because, they have very different value propositions. If you want WordPress, you can still have your WordPress. You (and me) are in web applications for different reasons than you are in WordPress.&nbsp;My focus was unlocking the&nbsp;value of being in web applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means that as much as I want to provide certain&nbsp;creature features, sometimes I simply did not. The most glaring creature feature absence, methinks, is the inablity to browser the server for existing image files. Something along the lines of the WordPress media manager. I assumed a third party installable package exists, but I just haven&#39;t come across the right package. Such a thing exists for CKEditor, but you have to pay up. So, you have to look at the server itself, via FileZilla (or whatever) to browse and upload. Oh, I built a &quot;featured image&quot; facility, which helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings me to something else: there is no &quot;page builder&quot; facility whatsoever in LaSalle Software. Nor is there going to be any. It is my bias that clients need to invest in their front-ends, so LaSalle Software is designed to force clients to invest in their front-ends! In so doing, the full power of the Laravel Framework, and in front-end development in general, is exposed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mention this because there is some overall vision with LaSalle Software. Certainly, there is an attitude about it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I had v1.0 done, I then built my own podcasting&nbsp;web application with it. It is a completely separate web app under my SouthLaSalleMedia.com domain. Instead of building one big app, I created four&nbsp;composer installable packages, so I can build other podcasting apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the first time I used my administrative form automation feature in a &quot;real world&quot; setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a huge PITA setting up admin back-end forms to enter data. My custom admin form automation feature creates these back-end forms automatically. When I was working on my admin form automation feature, I was pretty sure it could save days of work. In a &quot;real world&quot; setting, it really did. But, in so doing, it put the focus on creating the custom database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database work has to be done first, up-front. The natural inclination to avoid thinking through the custom database that underlies custom web app development, because it is a grinding, unglamourous, and somewhat unforgiving, exercise is now countered by the need to do it first.&nbsp;Furthermore, my admin form automation forces you to build your custom database in a certain way -- which I consider to be a classic &quot;normalized&quot; structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can use my&nbsp;form automation as a discovery process, because instead of spending money to build forms, money can be invested in figuring out the database. We can &quot;spin up&quot; a proof-of-concept web app, that exists solely to work on the database. When the database is figured out, we delete the &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; web app.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really, as it&#39;s turned out,&nbsp;I&#39;ve been my own first LaSalle Software client. Which was the only way I could understand how to bring v1.0 to a &quot;client-ready&quot; state. Every day I use one or both of my two major sites: this Flagship site; and, my podcasting site. My four single page software sites are pretty well static sites right now. My Flagship site has stuff on the back-end that does not display at all on the front-end: there&#39;s a Knowledge Base, a tiny little to-do app, and my customer database. All built with my form automation, and all are&nbsp;composer installable packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have consistently resisted introducing javascript into LaSalle Software&#39;s administrative back-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to keep to strict Laravel in my admin. Javascript requires its own workflow, a workflow I do not want to introduce into the admin. So there is no edit-in-place right now, which is the one feature that I think has the most compelling reason to use javascript. On the other hand, without javascript to make it &quot;too easy&quot; to delete records, I created a separate form for delete confirmations, making it harder to blithely delete records before realizing you (me!) deleted the wrong record.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Laravel internal software workflow is preserved throughout the admin-side processing, which is what I value&nbsp;more right now than what I consider some finer &quot;consumer oriented&quot; &nbsp;creature features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Access control levels was supposed to be an integral feature of v1.01. It never made it because access control went from &quot;if person is a &#39;super administrator&#39;, then person can access admin back-end&quot; to &quot;if person can use lookup table code &#39;publish&#39;, then trigger the &#39;publish&#39; event&quot;. I&#39;ll deal with the huge scope creep post-version 1.01.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating a set of customer database records is a big success. The original intent of creating this set of database tables was to have it available for integration when building other things. So, my to-do list is associated with my customer database. Upon registering, I built the ability to create customer records from the basic registration form.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building out CRM features is not a priority right now. But, using one unified customer database is a huge priority right now, which is why the customer database exists. And I am glad that it is there, because I&#39;ve already integrated it with other features. And, I&#39;ve been able to integrate customers with LaSalle Software/Laravel Framework users as part of basic&nbsp;LaSalle Software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am thrilled to release LaSalle Software Version 1.01.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It represents the fulfillment of its original intent, to provide critical software scaffolding allowing my clients to get into web applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It represents a stability of performing on modern cloud servers using modern deployment techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It represents technological leverage --&nbsp;to speed up development, to focus investment in high-value added areas, to build on hooks for future development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'I am thrilled to announce the release of LaSalle Software version 1.01 &#34;client-ready&#34; today....', 'I am thrilled to announce the release of LaSalle Software version 1.01 &#34;client-ready&#34; today....', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/announcing-lasalle-software-version-101', 'announcement-retro.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2016-02-08', '2016-02-09 09:29:00', 1, '2016-02-12 03:26:21', 1, NULL, NULL),

Version 1.01 marks the culmination of the effort to get LaSalle Software off the ground, and to the point where the basic functions exist; and, where the software performs in a stable way in production.&nbsp;The basic functions exist; and, things were done with a keen eye on future development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software gives us a head start with our custom web application development. To give us a true head start, a full customer database exists with which to integrate with future development. Certain types of features were put into separate installable packages to make it easier for future development to access those features -- which is something you do not see visually on a site, but underneath is a big help. Version 1.01 has a lot of things that exist for future development, but would not otherwise exist if the prime objective was merely to provide basic scaffolding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From here, the focus shifts from dealing with software &quot;infrastructure&quot; to feature building. With one massively huge exception: the building of granular access control.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The need to create access control levels (ACL) at the lookup table value level was enough to have me defer the entire ACL feature to post-v1.01.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACL as a driver of workflow is something I had contemplated until I started talking to actual real people about what &quot;value bottlenecks&quot; they were experiencing. The initial answers were &quot;workflow&quot;. Given ACL&#39;s intimate association with workflow, its scope skyrocketed. Preventing one person from &quot;publishing&quot; a blog post; and, allowing another person to &quot;publish&quot; a blog post, increases the scope of ACL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I turned my attention to other v1.01 features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to complete these packages over the next few months:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>events (get it started meaningfully, if not actually finish it, as I sense development will be ongoing);</li>\r\n	<li>email &quot;micro-service&quot; with Lumen and&nbsp;Mandrill;</li>\r\n	<li>enhanced contact form using LaSalleCRM;</li>\r\n	<li>list of installed LaSalle Software packages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first client is my volunteer proof-of-concept web application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am developing the events package strictly due to this web app. I am relying on my admin form automation to speed things up, but in so doing I&#39;ll probably have to have a &quot;white board&quot; session to figure out the database. The crux of admin form automation is &quot;CRUD&quot; - the database tables and the &quot;create&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, and &quot;delete&quot; of records.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using email within LaSalle Software is one of my long-held pet projects. This proof-of-concept web app gives me a fine excuse to get going with it. I found an article describing how to get a basic email &quot;micro-service&quot; up-and-running with Lumen and Mandrill, so I am happy to have an excuse to get to it. Combined with what I learned at the True North PHP Conference last November, I have my fingers crossed that I can get this thing going in one sitting. Yeah, as if.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I do get this email thing going, the idea is to associate emails with customers. Then, to create a front-end dashboard with emails. And, then, for any notifications, to put them on the dashboard as well. We&#39;ll see how far we get in a few months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to get a solid handle on ACL over the next few months. I sense that it&#39;ll take iterative development to get a strong idea of how to really do it. Once we figure it out, ACL will become an intimate aspect of LaSalle Software. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have to retool things that I&#39;ve already done, and i want to retool just once!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, what is upcomng is the start of ecommerce development.

Well, I thought, I would probably find a Laravel based ecomm solution and so I would specializse in that, because why should I reinvent what already existed. But, deep down, I really wanted to develop my own thing. Probably because I had just seen my huge effort developing&nbsp;Joomla ecommerce go down the tubes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually did start my ecommerce development with Laravel right away. I had this wonderful data model already, so I revisited it as a head start for my Laravel ecommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I was bumping into the same wall over and over again. I needed a sub-system to for customer data. I needed a sub-system for login/logout/registration. I need basic authorization. I needed a back-end to manage the database. I had the scaffolding&nbsp;built in with Joomla, but now I had nothing. And without the basics, there was no way I could build the ecommerce. So I decided -- well, I was forced -- to focus on the scaffolding. I was building a tiny little blog app anyways just to learn Laravel -- you have to build something to learn it, and it seemed that the first thing people build with Laravel is a blog app -- so I added a few extra things to my list. So my little blog app grew into LaSalle Software... but I digress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a constant eye towards building ecommerce software -- with perhaps ecommerce becoming the crown jewel of LaSalle Software -- I built LaSalle Software to its current version 1.01 release. However, I have not actually developed the ecommerce at all since discovering that I need a whole bunch of stuff first.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I have that &quot;whole bunch of stuff first&quot; now, so I can finally start my ecommerce development in earnest. Ah, but not the same development I had started back in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My initial impulse was to recreate what I did with my Joomla ecommerce add-on with Laravel. However, as I progressed with my LaSalle Software, I changed my attitude about LaSalleMart. I soon concluded, and it took a while to so conclude,&nbsp;that I absolutely had to create a true LaSalleMart API. Not just an internal API as I had built, where I isolate the processing, using the command bus to get the internal &quot;request&quot; to the processing package. No, a real API. Even though I was not building a software-as-a-service site, my clients need a real API for their ecommerce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is why at the True North PHP Conference I attended every API session I could get to. Which is why I&#39;ve been reading up on API development. API&#39;s have become a bit of a hobby for me, as I chip away at familiarizing with the in&#39;s-and-out&#39;s. It&#39;s clear that the real learning will start once I actually get going with LaSalleMart&#39;s API development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also going to dive into automated testing for the LaSalleMart API, in part because I need to get into it once-and-for-all; and, because there really is no manual way of testing an API. There is no web site with which to view the API. So, I need unit tests to ensure that the calculations are correct. The learning never ever ends, eh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am quite sure now that I will use RAML and MuleSoft&#39;s API tools for LaSalleMart&#39;s API.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am quite sure now that I will use Lumen for LaSalleMart&#39;s API, after mulling using a stripped down version of Laravel. Lumen is the stripped down Laravel, adjusted specifically for API usage -- right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ecommerce gets very&nbsp;involved. very quickly. I remember how scope exploded with coupons. Product price is hardly straight-forward. Shipping is a universe unto itself. My default development position is to figure out all the twists and turns, and build that into the data model right at the start of development. Because building in complexity later will necessitate re-writing software. Now that the time has arrived to dive into LaSalleMart API development, the reality is that there is no way I can plan up-front for complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is much more important, at this stage of development, to get a basic working LaSalleMart API in place. That I learn RAML, the API tools, the testing, and that I can set up little web app so I can see it in action -- and so I can confront the issues that will inevitably come up integrating LaSalleMart&#39;s API with the greater LaSalle Software that it integrates with. Further, I plan on building LaSalleMart composer installable packages for the API, as opposed to building &quot;one big app&quot;, which was such a disaster for LaSalle Software that I won&#39;t even try it for the ecomm API.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the time comes to create umpteen different coupon types, I trust that my&nbsp;package development approach, and my (somewhat) attention to building databases in &quot;fifth normal form&quot; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form</a>), will be enough to handle all the upcoming feature&nbsp;twist and turns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s a good presentation about API&#39;s and RAML.&nbsp;It&#39;s from 2014, but still a good presentation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RI5iZgOtis\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart&#39;s API will be released FOSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe down the road I&#39;ll place some packages in private repos -- such as a Canada Post Shipping package.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will blog about LaSalleMart&#39;s API development as I progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'LaSalleMart ecommerce API to be a true API, not an internal API.

You don&#39;t even have to install these -- although you probably will.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are nine packages comprising &quot;LaSalleCMS&quot;, most of which are mandatory. You&#39;re not going to get far without the User Management package.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, I&#39;ve synchronized the version numbers. Which is ok, because the packages were basically in &quot;beta&quot; until the v1.01 release.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it&#39;s important to get fixes to you asap. Synchronizing version numbers means I cannot get updates to you until I get around to tagging the version numbers on all the packages at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, I want to keep to Semantic Versioning (<a href=\"http://semver.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://semver.org</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I will tag my packags individually as required.

I decommissioned all my shared hosting sites, and live deployed six of my own web applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second LaSalle Software client is... a volunteer site: a proof-of-concept web application for my synagogue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The existing site is a going-concern WordPress site. The short story is that there is a need for customization, so I offered to do a proof-of-concept LaSalle Software web application. The things that need developing are the same things that my paying clients will need. Workflow and email are important for LaSalleMart. It will be good to develop these things with a real web app for a real organization, because it will increase the quality and relevance of the software. If things go wrong along the way, there are not the usual budgetary and time pressures associated with a paid engagement. OTOH, I think that it would be a Good Idea to take the proof-of-concept web app live by summer&#39;s end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month I will set up the proof-of-concept web application on my RetroRadioes.com, a domain I have for development.

So, I&nbsp;do not lack not topics with which to blog and podcast.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I tackle these topics, I need to keep communicating about LaSalle Software.

Hey, why not share it with the world! Figuring out my own sites is hard. Figuring out my own marketing is hard. There is a big difference between advising a client, and doing it for myself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I confess something else: it&#39;s not really that hard, I have been on a singular path all along. The problem is that I have not found proper expression.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This evening, at the PHP meet-up, I surprised myself how intense I was in opposition to the idea of WordPress presentations in particular, and CMS presentations&nbsp;in general. Both presentations are reasonable for a PHP meet-up, but I, um, demurred at the idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also last weekend, I had a brief chit-chat about WordPress that brought to bear the Value Proposition of LaSalle Software. I thought, well, would I want to actually say this stuff on my podcast? On my Flagship site&#39;s home page?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the one hand, I do not want to seem like I am bashing anything. On the other hand, LaSalle Software exists for a reason, and given the extensive effort and commitment that brought LaSalle Software to fruition, it&#39;s obvious that there was a need to satisfy with my Software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I seem especially twisted up in a ball when it comes to describing my LaSalle Software. I need to get down to the nub of things, and tell my story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, basically, what I plan to do, is just give a no-shitter. Not that my next podcast will have that title. But that&#39;s the topic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok... look, first of all the landscape has changed tremendously over the last few years. Something I&#39;ve been communicating someone cogently, I trust. Traditional self-enclosed content systems hosted on shared servers made sense years ago, but is on the way out now. Yes, you heard me, on the way out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were three popular PHP content systems: Drupal, WordPress, and Joomla. Hard to believe that there was a time when Joomla was more popular than WordPress! Well,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drupal dropped a bomb on itself and blew itself to smithereens. Drupal 8 is a complete&nbsp;re-invention, a full do-over, emerging as a web application platform with which to do your own custom web apps. They based their re-invention on the Symfony Framework, exactly like Laravel. I was very much interested in specializing in Drupal 8, but guess what? They took so long to release D8 that I released LaSalle Software v1.0 first. I&#39;ve had it up-to-here depending on open source projects to get around to releasing their software. Been there, done that. The key takeaway here is that Drupal decided to abandon their traditional content system, and create a brand new thing specifically for web applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla. Ah, Joomla. Joomla has had a web app framework for years. Did you know that? It&#39;s a separate thing from Joomla 3. You remember that my Joomla ecommerce extension was based on a fabulous third party framework? There is now a stand-alone version of this framework,&nbsp;separate from Joomla. There is a recent announcement of another third party web app framework for Joomla, or something. Look, all that I really want to convey is that Joomla is experiencing pressures with transforming into a web application development thing-a-ma-jig.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress is the CMS everyone seems to have heard about. Well, do you know that they are stuffing web application thingees into WordPress?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web application technology is not chasing the traditional content systems. Au contraire! Oh no! It is the traditional content systems that are chasing web application technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If these projects are chasing web app technology, then shouldn&#39;t you be doing the same thing?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drupal is backed by a commercial business, who&nbsp;decided that they will&nbsp;simply abandon their investment in favour of re-doing Drupal as a web app platform. WordPress is backed by a commercial business with a $1+Billion valuation, who want to keep what they have built up but still want to web app-i-fy it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are these people, or are these people not, transmitting to you something about what you should be doing? They are! They are telling you to get into web applications. That maybe you need to dump what you have completely in order to do it. And, that, they are still at it doing the transformation. So, maybe if you are at it for a while, it&#39;s situation normal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web applications is about custom software development. It&#39;s not about bolting pre-fab stuff all over the place and coming up with this perfect thing just they way you want it. Web application technology is about the unprecedented access to custom software development. It&#39;s about costs dropping like a stone. The barriers are coming down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the general trend is moving to web applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMPOSER INSTALLABLE PACKAGES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WORDPRESS SEEMS OVERSOLD TO ME, CONSULTANTS KNOW NOTHING ELSE, CONSULTANTS KNOW DIPSHIP ABOUT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, DO NOT CODE PHP (or anything else), WORDPRESS HAS A &nbsp;PROPRIETARY non-normalized database design that matters a great deal when it comes to custom work -- and that WooCommerce weaves into instead of developing its own new fresh modern db design. Yeah, I know, WordPress is coming out with interfaces so you can use this crappy database in a modern way, so I&#39;ve read.&nbsp;</p>', 'With an ambitious development schedule that is only picking up after releasing LaSalle Software vers...', 'With an ambitious development schedule that is only picking up after releasing LaSalle Software vers...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/confessions-of-a-software-purveyor', 'confession1.jpg', 0, 0, 0, '2016-02-23', '2016-02-24 09:58:54', 1, '2016-02-24 10:48:55', 1, NULL, NULL),

They had a good design, and then made it even better. Their site flows well. Very impressive UX.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion, MailChimp is uniquely superb at communications. They are candid, they are very detailed at explaining what they are thinking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;announcement yesterday that they are going to close down their free tiers strikes me as being very out of character for MailChimp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For such a major change, they would have communicated what they are considering when they were considering it -- and why there were considering it.

I will be taking them up on their suggestion, and I&#39;ll be frank here, likely never to return to MailChimp. I have plans to build email capabilities into LaSalle Software, and using SES is very attractive. Amazon just took their WorkMail live, with March being the first billable month (they&#39;ve been warning me for two months). SES can now handle incoming emails. Incoming SES emails can be routed to WorkMail, so that has possibilities.

Just like Laravel, they took the Symfony Framework as their base. This Schumpeter Creative Destruction took a lot of resolve and decisiveness of action. I was very interesting in adopting Drupal 8 as my new web app specialty. But, and it&#39;s a Biggee: they took a l-o-n-g &nbsp;t-i-m-e to get their baby to reversion one point oh.

So any framework can use it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of Composer-installable packages out there, with more being released each week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Software is comprised of composer-instalable package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PHP Improvements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PHP has come a long way. It is a modern language, not just a scripting language. PHP is extremely popular, and very established. Just wanted to mention this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Continuous Software Development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was programmers who developed a tool to help them with the software build process, because such a tool (and related processes) was lacking. I cannot stress enough that programmers knew exactly where value was, and selfishly created tools for themselves to extract this value. In so doing, they gave birth to an industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I trace the start of &quot;continuous&quot; with the advent of the Jenkins Server, which was, and is, incredibly, FOSS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unleashing &quot;continuous&quot; technology has driven down the cost of releasing software. But, it does put a technology burden on software creators. After all, it was the programmers themselves who birthed this technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Laravel Framework</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion, the Laravel Framework makes web app software creation more accessible to programmers. What was a software sub-specialty is now mainstream software development, in large part to the Laravel Framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Git and GitHub.com</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Git is the name of version control software -- for software! Version control software for software is not new. But Git&#39;s innovations are new, and are now mainstream accepted. GitHub.com is the gold standard of git based cloud software repositories, and is the most popular site for open source software collaboration &amp; projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Application Programming Interfaces (API&#39;s)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The more you get into building your web applications, the more youi&#39;ll be using cloud services and external API&#39;s. It&#39;s a big interconnected scalable world out there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I want to convey is that we are the beneficiaries of immense toil, passion, and investment. The sole outcome, it seems, is to make (web) application development accessible to everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Companies borrowed heavily in recent years, but often bought back stock rather than investing in the...', 'Companies borrowed heavily in recent years, but often bought back stock rather than investing in the...', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/billion-dollar-investments-just-to-make-web-app-dev-accessible-to-you', 'inaccessible1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2016-02-28', '2016-02-29 00:24:34', 1, '2016-07-13 08:17:26', 1, NULL, NULL),

No logging in, no file uploading, no fuss, no muss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh boy, what a journey of discovery this turned into. It&#39;s the details, oh, it&#39;s the details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, it&#39;s turned into a series of new core LaSalle Softwaere features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Email Handling in the Administrative Back-end</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My lovingly build admin form automation handles standard database &quot;CRUD&quot; actions. Email handling is its own thing altogether, so I hand crafted the admin forms. I gained a deeper appreciation for my own form automation feature, I can tell you that -- it really does save a lot of time setting up the back-end forms. I achieved a very basic type of email handling in the back-end, which is what I wanted. Not to mention I gained a very healthy respect for what it will take to develop truer email features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, an email that comes in and is processed displays in the back-end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, now, I can route a message from a contact form back to the web apps admin. To reply, you&#39;ll have to set up new outbound email in the admin, I didn&#39;t develop some miniature Zoho or something. In due time, although I&#39;m thinking more in terms of a ticketing system. Hmmm....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inbound Email Handling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoa, is this a whole different thing than outbound email. Outbound is easy! Inbound is a completely different thing. Someone sends an email to a special email address. An API, I use Mailgun, receives the email, parses it, then sends the parsed data as POST variables to my web app&#39;s endpoint. If you did not understand that, then at least know that having left Kansas, you have arrived at your new destination!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have standard inbound processing for inbound email handling. It is based on Mailgun&#39;s specific POST vars, but the processing I kept as generic as I could -- so we can use an interface down the road regardless of the inbound API used.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting close to wrapping up the inbound email handling. With so much accomplished, the last piece is inbound attachment handling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Token Base Front-end Login</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing that I&#39;ve always wanted, but not a priority. Until now. Turns out that the groundwork was laid with Two Factor Authorization. The ability to click a link and then be automatically logged in as if you&#39;re jumping from one tablet app to another -- well, it&#39;s a beautiful thing. No passwords, no login screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lowering Barriers to Web App Development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My LaSalle Software is supposed to get you into Laravel based web apps faster and inexpensively. It&#39;s feature set exists as an advanced starting point for your custom web app development. Most of my effort over these last couple of weeks was spent developing these new core features, rather than on the custom workflow my client needs. This is my first paid LaSalle Software gig, so it&#39;s my first opportunity to see if my intentions are realistic. Indeed, they are. Had these features already existed, I&#39;d already have my proof-of-concept done. Exactly what I am aiming for. I want my clients to have targeted-scoped web apps that are quickly and inexpensively built and maintained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'It&#39;s been an intense couple of weeks getting into a whole new area for LaSalle Software.

The problem is that the steady decline in service over the last year has become destructive. For example: there&#39;s no notification of impending SSL expiration (where there were before), and getting renewed is not necessarily an easy matter. But, it was the frequency of sites getting hacked that was the final straw. Was the hack due to the webhost? Well, we do not know precisely. For us, the pattern was disturbing enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is: which webhost? My immediate thought was Rochen.com because they had a good reputation when I was active with Joomla. They are still <a href=\"http://website.informer.com/Rochen+NOC+Rochen+Limited.html\" target=\"_blank\">independently owned</a>, as far as I can tell. They still host the main Joomla site(s). They certainly understand Joomla &amp; WordPress and, word was, they customized their servers for &#39;em. But for all these reasons, and &nbsp;other reasons, a stand-out reason for me is reading through the Akeeba Backup support tickets. Whenever there is a problem with Akeeba Backup using Rochen, there is an exact set of steps to fix the problem. Rochen is favoured, and the hint -- at least to me -- is to switch to Rochen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can tell you that Akeeba Backup files&nbsp;over a mere 10Mb were failing to upload to Amazon&#39;s S3. Not only did none of my ministrations fix the problem, but I knew that it had to be the webhost. The backups were not failing because the jpa and sql files were on the local folder. The uploads were failing, and they were failing across different accounts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been only a couple of weeks actually using Rochen, but so far, so good. I am happy with support. There is LetsEncrypt SSL at a click of the button. Support is very knowledgeable, and I&#39;ve not had to deal with &quot;switching you to level 2 support&quot; crapola.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used to think that Rochen was very premium priced, but it is actually cheaper than the &quot;business plan&quot; at the ol&#39; standby. Each account comes with 60Gb of SSD which is very fair. I am taking well to the main portal &amp; cpanel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that this is a review, mind you. We made a tough decision and made the move. And so far, so good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, Akeeba Backup is workiing beautifully on Rochen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is important to note, especially if you are a client, is that Rochen is my new webhost of choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, a note about email. I&#39;ve had a very interesting journey with email. There is no email hosting on my Digital Ocean cloud servers (well, unless I set &#39;em up, and I would not suggest it), so what to do with email? I am trying to avoid Google Apps. I am not enamoured with my domain registrator&#39;s email service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, to be frank, I really liked using my webhost&#39;s email. Unlimited email, forwarding was a snap, getting the email to work in regular Google was pretty easy. I was hoping that Amazon Web Service&#39;s Workmail would do the trick, but they&nbsp;need&nbsp;to build-out its feature set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I&#39;m going to get a Rochen account solely for the email.

So there shouldn&#39;t be a problem finding a long established full featured backup plugin for WordPress, right? Well, for me, the answer is wrong.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, my dissatisfaction with free and commercial backup plugins has me searching again and again for backup plugins. Backing up the database and uploading it to Amazon&#39;s S3 is definitely covered, no trouble finding a plugin for this. The site files, and restoration? Well, that&#39;s a different matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I&#39;ve found over the years is that backing up the WordPress folders and files is trickier than it appears. One reason is that errors emanate from the webhost, not from WordPress (or MySQL). Sometimes errors happen because of differing PHP versions. Sometimes the backup works but the upload to Dropbox or Rackspace or whatever fails. Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of cloud storage outfits to keep up with. And, y&#39;know, WordPress users just want&nbsp;plugins &quot;to just work&quot;. When it comes to backing up, it&#39;s enormously difficult to have it &quot;just work&quot; when there are so many potential externally based points of failure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restoring WordPress sites is not fully straight forward. Site URLs are stored in the database where they really shouldn&#39;t be in the first place -- confession: this little WordPress twist-and-turn so infuriates me that I refuse to fully understand it! Suffice to say, you have a development site, and now you want to go live on the live URL, you can&#39;t just import the database straight up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve seen some pretty whacky plugins that &quot;import&quot; and &quot;export&quot; WordPress sites. People who need to move WordPress sites around concocted their own plugins to deal with the WordPress idiosyncracies, and ended up publishing them. My hats off to people who release free open source software. But there&#39;s a certain point where I&#39;m not interested in, essentially, reverse engineering peoples&#39; home made solutions to idiosyncracies baked into the core software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s no secret that I&#39;m a huge fan of Akeeba Backup for Joomla. I&#39;ve had the pleasure, and a pleasure it was, interviewing Akeeba&#39;s founder many times in the old days of my The Bob Bloom Show (<a href=\"https://southlasallemedia.com/tbbs48\" target=\"_blank\">https://southlasallemedia.com/tbbs48</a>). Nicholas has been through it all dealing with all the sordid issues involved backing up Joomla sites. It really does seem so straight forward at first, but it&#39;s incredible how un-straight-forward it becomes. I could not fathom doing a Joomla site without Akeeba Backup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, when Akeeba Backup for WordPress came out, I was very excited. It took&nbsp;some time transmuting&nbsp;this wonderful Joomla extension into a WordPress plugin. A journey worthy of another podcast! Suffice to say, it was successfuly transmutted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I cannot fathom doing a WordPress site without Akeeba Backup Pro for WP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination of <a href=\"https://my.rochen.com/?link=12383\" target=\"_blank\">Rochen.com</a> hosting and Akeeba Backup is, so far, incredible. My Akeeba Backup CRON jobs -- they all upload to AWS S3 -- have 99% success (can never bat 1.000, eh!). Small database files, large full site archive files -- they all work (except for an outlier here-and-there), unattended, in the middle of the night, via CRON jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restoring an Akeeba backed up WordPress site is straight forward (and GUI based), once you get the hang of it. The WordPress idiosyncracies are handled well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Akeeba Backup Solo Professional -- for Laravel!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For my Laravel web applications, I want to use a Laravel backup package. I want it Laravel all the way. Except, that, and does this sound familiar? I am unsatisfied with the backup packages. There&#39;s just not enough functionality to them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s fabulous that people publish free open source software. The backup packages hook in beautifully with Laravel -- and Forge. They use the Symfony console. They upload to S3. There is nothing wrong with the backup packages I tried. I wanted more functions, so, I forked a package. And, then, I deleted it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more valuable? Using a Laravel based backup package, or installing Akeeba Backup &quot;Solo&quot; Pro? This is the standalone version of Akeeba Backup Pro.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, a standalone version of Akeeba Backup.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I tried it last night. Set up a subdomain on my DigitalOcean-slash-Forge-slash-Envoyer droplet. First time I set up a subdomain --&nbsp;figured it out. First time I set up a subdomain for LetsEncrypt SSL -- figured it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Akeeba Backup Solo Professional works, and works beautifully. The one install backs up, with individual backup jobs, each database, and each set of files. Akeeba Backup sees the droplet&#39;s file structure, so I can have one job backup &quot;/home/forge/domainONE.com/storage/images&quot;, and another job backup &quot;/home/forge/domainTWO.com/storage/images&quot;. With Envoyer&#39;s symlinks, this is no moot point. Also, unlike backing up WordPress, I do not want to backup the entire folder structure of my app that resides on the droplet; rather, I only want to backup files that originate from the app&#39;s usage. Such as&nbsp;user uploaded images.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kudos to the <a href=\"https://www.akeebabackup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Akeeba Team</a> for bringing their mature, full featured backup software to my Laravel web apps!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'I use, and recommend Akeeba Backup Professional for WordPress and Laravel web application backups.', 'I use, and recommend Akeeba Backup Professional for WordPress and Laravel web application backups.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/akeeba-backup-for-laravel-and-wordpress', 'akeebabackup.png', 1, 0, 0, '2016-07-14', '2016-07-14 18:02:11', 1, '2016-07-15 07:23:44', 1, NULL, NULL),

I also assume that the general public is similarily familiar given the general pervasiveness of keyword searches. After all, the Android operating system is made by Google (<a href=\"https://www.android.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.android.com</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrong!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I thought, while I&#39;m thinking of it, to post a little missive on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason is that I am opinionated about approaching SEO in the web apps that I build, and I want to blog about it sooner than later given that my new SouthLaSalle.ca site is in the works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, I before I forget, &quot;keyword search&quot; is not social media. I was not sure if the person I was talking to was lumping in the idea of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) with social media.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second of all, before I forget, remember that all the content you enter into social media is the property of that social medium. How they display your content, how they filter it, their tagging mechanisms -- all this stuff is entirely in their control and subject to their whims and fancies. It is their property, of which has value, that you&#39;ve contributed, whose mechanism to unlock that value is completely in their purview.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the bedrock of SEO, in my opinion, is to have your own website. On your own (shared) server, with a domain that you own yourself (and not registered where you host your site).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are all used to searching for sites based on a keyword search. What we are not used to is being one of those sites people find in those keyword searches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a business, you want people to find you when they do keyword searches. Which means, you want to be on the first page of search results that people see when the list of sites are displayed. You want to be one of those sites that are first displayed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is where I get very opinionated:&nbsp;SEO does not stop at the point where people see your site displayed in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s assume that everyone who sees your listing in the search results clicks to your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even then, what is the difference between a dozen people a day clicking to your site and then leaving, and a million people a day clicking to your site and then leaving. &nbsp;The issue for you is not getting people to your site, the issue is getting people to do that thing you want them to do once they are on your site. What it comes down to for you is people buying things. Or people sigining up for newsletters. Or people clicking the &quot;submit&quot; button on your contact form.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My opinion is that you first design your site for conversion. Conversion is the act of someone doing that thing you want them to do on your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way I look at it, there&#39;s only two ways to go when someone is on your website: abandonment, and conversion. There is no third thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My opinion is that you need to reverse conventional wisdom: people obsess about SEO, but ignore conversion. Instead, you should focus on&nbsp;conversion first, then SEO. In fact, I am sure that by starting properly with conversion, you will do better with SEO.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, let&#39;s say you took care of conversion. A nice percentage of site visitors convert. So, what about SEO? What about social media?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s ignore social media here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about SEO?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I have a secret for you! Google Analytics is free.

That&nbsp;date is not confirmed, but the plan is to open by year&#39;s end. So, ahead of the opening, and ahead of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/summits/enterprise-summit-toronto/\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto Enterprise Summit</a>, AWS did this &quot;Awsome Day&quot; late summer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I attended because it was an opportunity to clear up the fuzziness I&#39;m having about AWS. Its services have exploded, and I&#39;m getting bogged down in what these services are; and, in the permissions settings in its &quot;IAM&quot;. Perhaps a day-long technical overview would clear up some cobwebs. It certainly helped that the day was free, and was designed for techies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day-long overview was conducted by an experienced AWS trainer, based on their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/essentials/\" target=\"_blank\">Technial Essentials</a>&nbsp;course. Thankfully, there was a section on IAM, so I scored big. The description of their data centers and &quot;Availability Zones&quot; was very helpful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were plenty of AWS people on hand to field questions during breaks and lunch. I was pleasantly surprised the day after to receive an email about a question I had asked, as promised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The talk on &quot;IAM&quot; (AWS Identity and Access Management) was a Big Help to me as it cleared up a few things for me. The AWS technical overview was also a Big Help. Asking the AWS &quot;Architects&quot; the few bothersome questions I had was also beneficial. When I go through the AWS screens I will have more context now. With the explosion of AWS services, this is a significant plus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I estimate, and this is purely me guessing and nothing else, that between 300-400 techies were there. The presentation was well done. The food and beverages at breaks and lunch were fantastic -- someone spent some serious money, but that someone was not me&nbsp;as the event was gratis. I knew of this event via an email invitation from AWS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Bob Bloom at Awsome Day Toronto 2016\" src=\"https://southlasalle.com/images/2016aug24_awsome_day/2016aug24_awsome_day_conference1.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:500px; margin:0px 0px 15px 20px; width:375px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no selling. Which is to say, the entire event was selling. The presentation was a technical tour of what are&nbsp;very technical products. But the idea was not to &quot;sell&quot; us techies on the merits of AWS. Rather, to technically describe AWS, and to let that be enough. You know techies:&nbsp;we hate being sold stuff, but we love shiny new toys.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge issue with AWS is &quot;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/26/the-clouds-biggest-threat-are-data-sovereignty-laws/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Sovereignty</a>&quot;. Like those commercials, data created in Canada needs to stay in Canada. Many&nbsp;Canuck corporations and government entities AWS is eyeing cannot use AWS right now because the data crosses the Canadian border. When the Montreal data centre opens, data does not have to cross the border.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it seems to me that AWS wants&nbsp;techies to understand the technical basics, so that these techies then convince&nbsp;their managers to attend the upcoming Summit. At the Summit, AWS will work over the managers pretty good! So, when the Canadian data centre opens, there will be a nice critical mass of Canuck users ready-to-go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>', 'On Wednesday, August 24, 2016, I attended the first Amazon Web Services &#34;Awsome Day&#34; held in Canada, at the Sheraton Centre in downtown Toronto.', 'On Wednesday, August 24, 2016, I attended the first Amazon Web Services &#34;Awsome Day&#34; held in Canada, at the Sheraton Centre in downtown Toronto.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/amazon-web-services-awsome-day-toronto', '2016aug24_awsome_day/2016aug24_awsome_day_conference1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2016-08-29', '2016-08-30 05:46:23', 1, '2016-09-07 21:49:40', 1, NULL, NULL),

I was so excited at the prospect of connecting with local devs, and so impressed at the turnout of that first meeting, and so frustrated that the efforts came to a grinding halt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am deeply impressed with the volunteer efforts of Peter Meth and Vic Metcalfe, organizers of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/GTA-PHP-User-Group-Toronto/\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\" target=\"_blank\">GTA PHP User Group</a>, to be at that initial meet-up to help get the &quot;GTA PHP User Group &#39;North&#39; &quot; group off the ground.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it was clear that that group would not pursue the &quot;North&quot; meet-up group, I approached Vic about continuing the effort. With his critical help, and with his insistence that the new group be run independently, I am now the organizer of the new York Region PHP User Group. Oh sure, Vic is so mild mannered when you meet him. But when Vic insists...&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/2D_zITtVJGA?t=6m12s\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/2D_zITtVJGA?t=6m12s</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still want to head to the downtown meet-ups. Well, maybe I can&#39;t make it down to all of them, but I want the opportunity to go. I assume there are many York Region PHP devs who feel the same as me.&nbsp;So, generally, the downtown meet-ups happen on the first week of the month, and the York Region meet-ups will happen on the third week. This month, September, it&#39;s the second and fourth weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am an avid subscriber of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://voicesoftheelephpant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://voicesoftheelephpant.com</a>, regular podcast publishers of 10 - 15 minute interviews with people active the PHP community. Especially in their local PHP user groups. A few interviewees have said that their biggest challenge in their local user group is finding speakers. So, they are arranging their meet-ups to be training grounds, so to speak, for local attendees to do presentations. What they have found, and what I am certain of here in York Region, is that there is a lot of talent and experience attending their local meet-ups, but it&#39;s hard to get developers to go up in front of a group -- especially a group of peers! -- and present something.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to take their lessons to heart. So, the first couple of York Region meet-ups, we&#39;ll have traditional styled meet-ups. But afterwards, I want to shake things up a bit to encourage attendees to share their knowledge and experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am looking forward to meeting you!

My clients enjoy that I do not link from their site to my site. My clients enjoy that I never create meta tags that refer to me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s also the fact that I do a lot of work for other consultants, who do not want to see their clients on my blog.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, I&#39;ve had bad experiences. The worst was a client held their testimonial hostage in return for extra unpaid work. All the clients testimonials and case studies on my website were unpublished within hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first paid LaSalle Software web application is an exception. In fact, my first three paid web apps may be exceptions simply because someone at a meet-up said that new software has &quot;traction&quot; when there are three paid web apps. When he said that, &quot;3&quot; became my &quot;magic number&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, this first one is special. Being the first it is the recipient of so much love that I sometimes think that this is my web app. It doesn&#39;t help me that for this first web app, and only for this first web app, I am using my own entire deployment suite. So, this web app feels like it&#39;s part of my own personal web app family -- SouthLaSalle.com, SouthLaSalleMeda.com, and LaSalleSoftware.ca.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason I am hoisting this web app onto my own deployment accounts is that I really do not know what to expect doing a web app for a client. So, I&#39;d really take this one under my wing, and later we can move deployment to the client owned SaaS accounts. This turned out well for me, because I did a pretty good job focusing on the web app itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The web app is Lely Tank Customer Care dot com (https://lelytankcustomerservice.com/).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of the site is to provide text &amp; image updates of custom truck construction&#39;s work-in-progress. Employees send text and images to the web app, and the web app displays this stuff to clients. The goal is to from smartphone to smartphone. An employee initials the update on their smartphone, and the customer sees their updates on their smartphone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fundamental proposition of LaSalle Software is it saves clients time and money, by giving them a&nbsp;software head start. Did this happen? Without a doubt, this is exactly what happened. What a thrill! I set up the initial web app and that was it. Had a one page home page. Had the admin. Had the logins management. How sweet it is!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I did not have a feature, oh boy, what a difference. Like day and night. The token-based login exists because we needed it. It&#39;s now a LaSalle Software FOSS&nbsp;installable package. I charged my client $0. Note for the future: will charge client, but probably not full rate, for packages that are released as LaSalle Software FOSS packages. It certainly is beneficial for clients to sponsor packages, in the &quot;we enjoy giving, we really enjoy getting&quot; department.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to base the token-based login on existing software was a huge time saver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest programming to do was the email parsing, which was a new thing for me. I was able to dig right into it because I did not have other programming to worry about (except the token-based login package).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I have an opportunity to use my admin form automation? Well, actually, yes. I had to add a new database table. So satisfying to report to you that the admin form automation was a big time saver. For LaSalle Software v2, I will ponder how to make the forms more customizable without having to do a full blown template over-ride.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This web app was 95% done in May, but was on hold until recently while the main site enjoyed its makeover.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'My first paid LaSalle Software web application went live Halloween 2016.', 'Software web application went live Halloween 2016.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/first-paid-lasale-software-web-app-is-now-live', 'lelytankcustomercare_home_page.png', 1, 0, 0, '2016-11-01', '2016-11-02 22:04:47', 1, '2016-12-15 08:48:55', 1, NULL, NULL),

It was at Microsoft Canada&#39;s Conference Centre in Mississauga, at their Canadian head office --&nbsp;a fabulous venue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organizers of the GTA PHP Group run this Conference, the same people who are instrumental in helping me launch the York Region PHP Group. This was my <a href=\"https://southlasalle.com/truenorthphpconference2015\" target=\"_blank\">second</a> of the five annual TNPHP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year&#39;s theme: this was the final TNPHP Conference. Which was not the intent, but everyone knew.&nbsp;The final talk was &quot;Last One Out Please Shut down The Conference&quot;, where Chris, Peter, and Vic got a well deserved Standing O.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This &nbsp;year, I had three&nbsp;things I wanted from the Conference: API, software testing, and meet-and-greet. Thumbs up on all three.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being on the cusp of re-doing LaSalle Software centred on an API, I wanted to absorb as much API goodness as I could. I attended specific API talks, but most of the talks that I attended touched on APIs in one form or another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I brought a stack of index cards with me to the Conference. When something was mentioned that I should think about for my LaSalle Software&#39;s API, I wrote it down. I came home with a nice stack of cards. An indication that APIs are very mainstream now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first two days I brought my laptop. A laptop is <em>de rigueur</em> for the tutorial day. For the first day of talks, maybe less so, but handy for looking things up.&nbsp;The third day I had&nbsp;enough of my laptop.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clearfix\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"images/2016nov05_true_north_php_conference/2016nov03_tnphp_phpunit_tutorial.jpg\"><img src=\"images/2016nov05_true_north_php_conference/2016nov03_tnphp_phpunit_tutorial.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:auto; overflow:hidden; padding:10px; width:400px\" /></a>The Hallway Track was an important part of this Conference. Enjoyed talking to the speakers, the width and breadth of their knowledge and experience is breathtaking. Talked to a lot of people I know from the local groups, including a handful from the York Region PHP Group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t know what it is, but I find PHPUnit a bit mysterious. I always seem to have trouble with it. I made a point of attending the three hour PHPUnit workshop. It didn&#39;t take long before I could not replicate the instructor&#39;s results. Naturally. So I basically ignored the talk and went about trying to figure things out. If worse came to worse, I would beseech help, because I need to get over this hump. Well, I figured things out. Namespacing and composer autoloading&nbsp;turned out to be the culprits. After that, PHPUnit worked beautifully. I then went through the doc on the PHPUnit website. It just came together for me. I know it&#39;s crazy, what&#39;s so hard about it?&nbsp;Oh well...&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it came time for the Laravel Testing talk on Saturday, I absorbed it all. Wrote lots of notes. Now, it&#39;s making sense. Wow, to see it in action with the live coding was a big help. For the first time, I am feeling confident about automated software tests for LaSalle Software v2. I was hoping the Conference would get me over the hump with this stuff and it did.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clearfix\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"images/2016nov05_true_north_php_conference/IMG_0205.JPG\"><img src=\"images/2016nov05_true_north_php_conference/IMG_0205.JPG\" style=\"float:left; height:auto; overflow:hidden; padding:10px; width:400px\" /></a>I expected that the talk on Saturday about the Laravel Container would be a step-by-step journey of the code, and the concepts behind, Laravel&#39;s container. Nope. It was a history of PHP containers, with a primer on how the PHP frameworks are doing containers&nbsp;now. But, maybe there&#39;s a reason this wasn&#39;t a deep dive into Laravel&#39;s source code. The lead-up into Laravel&#39;s Container makes more sense with the historical context. Actually, I am so used to using Laravel that I did not appreciate how elegant Laravel&#39;s solution really is. Really nice to see the speaker so enthusiastic about Laravel!&nbsp;Now, I have to deep dive into Laravel&#39;s source code, now that I have a better idea about Laravel&#39;s &quot;inversion of control&quot; container.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The True North PHP Conference may have concluded, but the Toronto PHP community is stronger and growing.

As for Twitter, I rely on Twitter to stay up-to-date on the technology that I am into, but technology has taken a back seat to politics. so I\'ve stayed away from Twitter.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy plan this year was to do a new version of LaSalle Software, get ecommerce going with LaSalle Software, consolidate all my content into one new site, and build up a renewed family of clients. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlthough things have not gone according to plan this year, things have been accomplished. What is clearly not good is that I\'ve been off the grid for far too long, and I can tell you now from hard experience that being off the grid is really bad for marketing! So I\'ve long concluded that once I\'m back on the grid, that I am staying on the grid. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI felt pretty strongly that a false start would be very bad -- getting back on the grid, then falling off again, then coming back. I would line things up properly to ensure that once back, I\'d stay. So things are now lined up. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI started this year doing something I had not done in a very long while: I took on short-term contracts. I was asked to \"help out\" with short term pressures on a contract basis not once, but twice back-to-back, by different people. I very much doubt I\'ll ever do contracting again. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI decided to wait for my contracting to conclude to start work on my software development because, basically, the only time I could work on my software was when I was supposed to be sleeping. The way this year has progressed, I decided that I would get things out of the way first that I was doing, and so clear the path for development. This is exactly what has happened.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOnce my contracts concluded, I had a client site to do, my meet-up sites to do, and my new consolidated site to do. They are all done and live. They took an immensely long time to do. I put the sites together with Laravel (of course), an admin package for Laravel (that was not quite plug-and-play), a generic template I modified for blade (there\'s a subject), and took code from version one of my LaSalle Software. Sometimes I think for all the effort to get these sites up I could have just developed the initial LaSalle Software packages first, but I know in full hindsight that I\'d have risked not having any sites up at all.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow that I have consolidated my sites into ibe new site, I have a list of things I want to communicate to you, so there\'s fresh content on the way, including re-starting my monthly podcast.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI\'ve been working on a home page that is different from anything I\'ve ever put together. Ultimately, what made me decide to go ahead with my home page idea is to be an example to my clients. Our home pages need to be much more visual, less text-y, significantly less cluttered, and much more media-ish-y. My site is the same, just my home page is different. \n<br /><br />\nThere are still issues with my new home page, but I am going ahead with it for two main reasons: the exercise of building it and maintaining it are extremely valuable; and, I achieved the basic premise for myself that I was aiming for.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis year we did something that we were not planning on doing, but had the opportunity to do, and we went for it. We made a major investment in our home office. We did a major home office reno, and we made major equipment investments. We were able to design and build from scratch a solution to accommodate our equipment, implement kick-ass wire management, make our modems accessible, and have a place for our stuff. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI am literally taken by surprise how our morale has shot up. The lighting is better, we are better organized, it is easier to diagnose internet outages, and we know what each wire is for. Our morale boost is a wonderful surprise.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWe now have equipment with the three major operating systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. We also have a range of tablets and smartphones. Frankly, we have a finer home office set up than I\'ve seen at many workplaces. Logistically, I have never been more able to serve my clients. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI also went off the beaten path by building what is called a \"Hackintosh\". I wanted more memory and hardware power for my MacOS, so I put together hand-picked computer hardware components myself to make a fully functioning computer. Then, I loaded the MacOS onto it. It was a real education. I call this computer my \"Laratosh\". \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI am very glad to be back!', 'After an extended hiatus in 2017, I am back!', 'After an extended hiatus in 2017, I am back!', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/i-am-back', 'imback.png', 1, 0, 1, '2012-09-11', '2017-09-11 16:30:05', 1, '2017-09-12 20:22:40', 1, NULL, NULL),

One rink is Olympic sized with seating. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI chose this facility for the fall 2017 York Region PHP and Laravel meet-ups because of lessons learned from our first meet-up season; and, because of time pressures.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLike so much of this year for me, my plan to do a deep scoping of York Region facilities for the meet-ups over the summer just did not go according to plan. Our home, and home office, renos were consuming and worthwhile (see my <a href=\"/i-am-back\">\"I\'\'m Back\"</a> post). Labour Day approached, and I went with the one facility that I knew that had most of what I was looking for. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nCheck out this map of York Region:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d367559.91274268966!2d-79.73088176123534!3d43.968429815179995!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x882acdaee4d2a679%3A0x108dcfb46a288a64!2sYork+Regional+Municipality%2C+ON!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1505312069846\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nYork Region is huge! A larger land area than Toronto.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nA Big Lesson I learned from our inaugural York Region PHP season is: Go North! The meet-ups were concentrated in the south central-ish area of York Region, which was too south for some attendees. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nMost of York Region\'s population is in the south on the border with Toronto. I figured that most of our attendees would be from the south, so as long as attendees could easily traverse laterally east-west, the meet-ups should be in York Region\'s south end. Well, the bulk of York Region\'s population may be due south, but PHP devs are all over, including in the north. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy goal is to get north and west, to get closer to the cluster of devs in the Barrie area. Barrie is not in York Region. However, the top end of York Region is to the east of Barrie, just on the other side of Lake Simcoe, so geographically thinking about the Barrie area is reasonable.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are two major north-south highways: the 400 is on the west side, and the 404 is on the east side. There is one major highway going east-west, and that\'s the 407. A fun aspect of the 407 is that it charges the highest toll fees in North America. Highway 7 is a highway in name only in York Region, as are many other east-west roads with the word \"highway\" in their name. Things to take into account.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThose in the Barrie area will be coming down the 400. Having them exit at Davis Drive and heading to the Upper Canada Mall area, at Yonge Street, seems like a good idea. Except that the area is becoming more and more congested. I am told that the stoplights are brutal on the new VIVA area east of Yonge. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe Magna Centre is in Newmarket, which is good. It is on the 404 side, not the 400 side, which is not so good, but it is on Mulock Drive which should be an easier west-to-east traversal than Davis Drive (is it?).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWe need to have meet-ups in venues where getting into the building is easy, getting into the actual meeting room is easy, and where going to the restroom is easy. We\'ve had attendees trying to get access to buildings after-hours in the middle of winter. We\'ve had attendees locked out of the meet-up after going to the restroom, and then knocking on the door to get back in. \n<br /><br />\nAll the downtown meet-ups I\'ve gone to are in corporate offices. Practically all of them are open concept, so despite the meet-ups being conducted in specific areas of the office, there are no physical barriers preventing attendees from going to areas that are private. Attendees are mindful of open-yet-private areas, and corporate hosts usually have staff at the meet-ups who keep on eye on things. I\'ve never heard of any incidents. \n<br /><br />\nAlso, there were \"open-yet-private\" issues last season that I am happily avoiding this fall by not contemplating corporate offices as venues. \n<br /><br />\r\nThe Magna Centre is a great choice for what I wanted. So I booked all our fall meet-ups there, and I paid the room rental fees. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe one downside to the Magna Centre is that one of the meeting rooms we will be in has a glass wall giving a fabulous view of the hockey rink. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />', 'Why did I choose the Magna Centre for the York Region PHP and Laravel meet-ups in the fall of 2017?', 'Why I chose the Magna Centre for the York Region PHP and Laravel meet-ups in the fall of 2017.', 'https://lasallesoftware.ca/why-the-magna-centre', 'magna_centre1.jpg', 1, 0, 0, '2017-09-11', '2017-09-11 13:45:59', 1, '2017-09-13 18:48:44', 1, NULL, NULL);

What topics should we cover? What speakers should we pursue?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLast season was the first for our meet-up group. I intentionally tried different venues, speakers, and topics for the simple reason that to find out what works I need to try different things. Let\'s get as many different types of venues, speakers, and topics covered just to see what is well received. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nActually, IMO, there were too many venues and too wide a range of topics and I want things to settle down this season. I hope to eventually have two venues that alternate: one at or near Newmarket, and the other either in the Beaver Creek area (404/407/7) or near the <a href=\"https://www.ttc.ca/Spadina/Stations/Vaughan_Metropolitan_Centre_Station/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">new Vaughan Metropolitan subway</a> at Jane/7 (close to 400/7). I\'m sure to have another post devoted to venues.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI learned that there is a tremendous range of topics of interest to PHP developers. Ok, so this is not exactly new. However, I find it shocking that we can spend an entire meet-up not talking about PHP. This is so because the fundamental nature of PHP development is having skills in a myriad of areas. A prime attraction of PHP meet-ups is staying up-to-date with the topics we need to know. But, what about devoting whole meet-ups talking about everything but PHP? <em>At what point do we become a meet-up group about general software development and not a PHP group?</em> And, what about deferring talks about specific topics where separate groups exist for those topics? Why devote presentations about WordPress or AWS or Symfony when local groups (and local conferences) exist for those frameworks and technologies? It\'s a tough call, because it\'s great to listen to overviews -- and then the discussions afterwards. On the other hand, as someone who attends meet-ups,  where is the meet-up about PHP?! \r\n<br /><br />\r\nA predecessor to the York Region PHP group was a Coffee-and-Code group that met each Sunday at a Richmond Hill Starbucks. So it was no surprise, and very welcomed, when the request for coffee-and-code workshops was raised. So we alternated months between a traditional meet-up, and a coffee-and-code workshop.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe coffee-and-code workshops were great. So much so that we should establish a York Region PHP Coffee and Code Group! The main reason to establish this new group is to delegate the organizing duties to someone else. I will gladly co-organize, but someone else has to take the reins. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.zendcon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ZendCon 2017 conference</a> is a great example of the huge range of topics of interest to PHP developers. There are six speaking tracks, six! \"PHP best practices\", \"PHP frameworks\", \"PHP communities\", \"IBM | development\", \"DevOps & Continuous Delivery\", and \"Open source ecosystem\". Wow, what a range. And the range within each track is vast. So there is no end of potential presentation topics for our local PHP group. And, there is an ever widening array of topics that are not so much PHP but are important skills for PHP devs. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nIMO, CI is profound. It changes the very nature of how we go about doing PHP development. So profound that I am willing to devote the bulk of the winter/spring meet-ups to CI. It is ridiculous the pressure PHP devs have on learning professional specialities that were so outside the purview of devs not so long ago. The pressure to understand dev-ops is intense. But this is the world we live in: technology has fused the various disciplines together into a seamless process. If our PHP group did not devote meet-ups every year to this profound change in the nature of our profession, would we not be remiss?  We can debate interfaces and design patterns until we are blue in the face, but it is more important to make sure PHP devs don\'t become obsolete by ignoring CI! \r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut, I digress... I want to get \"back to basics\" with PHP this fall. Hence the initial \"PHP 7\" presentation. However, the imperatives of mentoring local speakers will, in large part, determine the topics.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhich brings me to the main thing: LOCAL SPEAKERS!\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI\'ve talked to meet-up organizers. I\'ve listened to a great many number of podcasts on organizing meet-ups and conferences. There is one huge massive lesson that is always conveyed: <em>long term meet-up success is tied to local speakers</em>. And, of course, naturally, the biggest challenge of organizing meet-ups: local speakers!\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOur Group is blessed to have the support of the GTA-PHP-slash-True-North-Conference organizers. Very Tangible Support. So we are connected to the growing number of PHP groups in the GTA, which definitely brings a richer experience to our local group. We now need to use this strength to become a self-supporting group, which means we need to develop our own local speakers. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind -- none! -- that an imperative of our Group is to develop local speakers. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI know, I know. Most people do not want to do public speaking. And even for experienced speakers, putting together slides and speaking notes is daunting. So some presentations should be done sitting down, should be brief, and should have no slides. Let\'s just relax about the whole thing. Of course, we are PHP devs, so if you can show us some code, that would be great! Funny enough, but sometimes I think we should just throw some code on a whiteboard. But, if you have a little repo on GitHub that would be great too!\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOne thing I learned from going to meet-ups over the years is that you need 20 minutes minimum for a presentation and discussion. You\'re going to hit on something that piques interest. You look at the time and 15 minutes blew by in the Q&A. You realize from the Q&A that it would have helped to have \"that pictogram that I saw a week ago\". So the next time you share your experience and knowledge, you have in mind to include code or something to show. For that part of your presentation, you stand up to point to something you are presenting. And that is how people get into doing presentations. Not because they are \"brave\", or are \"extroverted\", or are \"especially trained on topic\", but it\'s just easier to explain the thing with that pictogram!\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe first presentation a local speaker should do is just share how they solved an intense PHP programming problem. At a recent downtown meet-up, a very experienced speaker said they had a problem with API authentication that none of the usual solutions solved, so they wrote their own. The exposition of what the problem was and why the usual frameworks/packages/best practices failed was fascinating. They pushed things and had to innovate. This is the type of thing a first time local presenter should do. Attendees love real-world stuff, so share your stories. Can you please bring alone some code samples -- maybe create a new public GitHub.com repo that we can look at on our laptops?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo think about a PITA problem you solved, and go through it at our next meet-up. Or, maybe it\'s not 100% solved and you want to hear ideas -- seen this too!\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSend me a missive!\r\n<br /><br />', 'I organize the York Region PHP meet-up group (we are on Toronto\'s north border).

However, it is really handy to break one’s own app into packages. My LaSalle Software version 1 was designed to use internal packages.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy experience with version 1 was that it did not take long for the code to get unwieldy. When I added a feature, despite organizing the code well, it became difficult to track down the code that needed updating. There was always so much other code to wade through too, which was quite distracting.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nExtracting features into packages made things so much better. I could work on a package without worrying that I would inadvertently break unrelated app features. I could work on multiple packages at once. I could see all the code for the package. I could tag as many releases as I wanted for a package without having to go through a release cycle for the app itself. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nMicroservices is a product of our times, now that we live in the age of The Cloud. Why have one big app, using packages, when we can break down our app into multiple apps. Each individual app can be optimized according to its size and usage. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow that The Cloud is accessible and cheap, microservices is as much about the infrastructure as it is about anything else. Sometimes while reading up on microservices I get the impression that it’s really all about the infrastructure. Deploying each app automatically is a big thing. Apps talking to the other apps securely is a huge thing. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nI’ve been feeling the growing presence of DevOps as an aspect to software development. This intimate integration seems to have full expression in the microservice architecture. You can’t have one without the other, and each must understand the other. I have to figure out the infrastructure that I am going to use before I write one line of code. My thinking right now is to be very practical about the infrastructure. Despite reading about Netflix and SoundCloud’s implementation, I will take a light touch to infrastructure, as I am hardly building out the new Netflix.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nRight now, I am looking at how my independent service apps will securely talk to each other. This is itself a sub-specialty topic. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nOnce I figure out how my independent service apps will securely talk to each other, I will design my service API’s with an API design tool. Even with a modest number of API’s — perhaps just three or four service API’s — I can see how it can get out of hand without using an API design spec. It’s enough that these tools can generate documentation.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSometimes, I do think it’s crazy going through all of this just to create a blog. But, clients will want more than just a blog. So this is the way to go. \r\n<br /><br />', 'The emphasis on infrastructure in the microservice architecture is intense.

I have enough to learn, so at some point it&#39;s not worth it for me to invest that extra time. Sure I can figure it out, but the time it will take for the payoff gained is not worth it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you the moment when I told myself, &quot;self, it would be great to use AWS more deeply, but I&#39;m having second thoughts&quot;. When I struggled to find out exactly how to save attachments to S3. The email comes into SES, where a rule set saves it to S3 as a raw email. Then, launch a&nbsp;Lambda function, so I read (on StackExchange, if memory serves), to save the attachments on another S3 bucket. Then, how do I mark the attachments as public? And, the example Lambda function failed, so I spent 1/2 hour figuring out how to fix it. Oh... no, it was the sample policy to give SES permission to write to my S3 bucket...&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I returned to my computer, I did not go to my AWS console. Instead, I looked up other email transactional API&#39;s. Having selected one for my in-bound emails, I deleted my DNS settings for AWS, and then deleted my WorkMail user, deleted my SES related S3&nbsp;bucket, and reverted my SES rule set to my original one. So, maybe at another time I will deep dive into AWS.

Personally, I think the bad and the ugly are far more interesting anyways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complimentary to my monthly LaSalleMart news podcasts will be my mid-month &quot;Hangout&quot; podcasts with Club Commerce Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>LaSalleMart Quick Hits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is Joomla ecommerce technology created &amp; maintained by Members of my Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is GPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are at the very start of LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GPL software is raw material here at Club Commerce. We&#39;re going to take in Tienda as raw material and modify it for our own use. We&#39;re going to take in Joomla as raw material -- I introduced you to the Square One Distro for a reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are highly incentivized to treat GPL software as raw material, and that&#39;s exactly what we are going to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>By and For Site Owners and Consultants</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce Members are site owners and consultants who are taking it upon themselves to create &amp; maintain their&nbsp; own Joomla ecommerce technology. LaSalleMart is ecommerce technology for consultants and site owners, by consultants and site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which of course sounds like total bullshit. How can people who don&#39;t program create and maintain their own technology?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The open source culture has co-opted non-programmers into the software development process; and, has pressured non-programmers into programming in some form or another. Plus, consultants and site owners are all-too-familiar with hiring people to fix and customize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it may sound like a bunch of hooey that non-programmers can develop software. But the reality is that despite our kicking and screaming, we are doing quite a bit of development ourselves already, thank you very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing consultants and site-owners haven&#39;t done yet is band together.&nbsp; A powerful idea whose time has come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Balls are in Our Court</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I cannot hammer home enough that the users of open source software, especially Free Open Source Software, shoulder all the risk of using that software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to deliver promised features? The software creator is off the hook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to deliver complete features? The software creator is off the hook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incompatibility with your web host? That&#39;s your problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feature doesn&#39;t work that worked in previous versions? That&#39;s your tough luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doesn&#39;t work with another critical extension? That&#39;s how the ball bounces, pal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long tail risks, common risks, unusual risks -- whatever the risk is, it&#39;s all yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why use such software? Because you can change the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have the power to change the code. But you must wield your power in order to reap the rewards to to lower your risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I confess, I don&#39;t lose sleep over not changing the code of the LAMP stack. Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, Joomla? Yeah, that&#39;s a different kettle of fish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Moneyball</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard of the book but never read it. The movie is a recent release but I just assumed it is a bubble gum vehicle for Brad Pitt. I know that Moneyball is about a small market major league baseball team using statistics in a different way than usual as the basis for competing with the big market teams. The movie talks about competing with the Yankees and Red Sox -- tell me about it, I live in Toronto, we&#39;re in the same division. The Jays hired a young general manager a few years ago, which I assumed was a nod to the new statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I really didn&#39;t know what was up until we popped in the DVD a couple of Sundays ago. A very good movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">Your goal shouldn&#39;t be to buy players, your goal should be to buy wins. In order to buy wins you need to buy runs.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>My dual major is accounting and economics, minoring in computer science, from the University of Toronto. I never got into the hard core calculus of econometrics -- but I can see how the discipline of applying statistics to model economies carries into modelling baseball leagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Moneyball movie is an interesting backdrop for telling you about how I want to approach LaSalleMart&#39;s development. And, truth be told, I could use a backdrop as context for &#39;splaining myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Econometrics has the word metrics in it. As in, something is being measured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Value&quot; is being measured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the essential question of Moneyball: <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">What is &quot;value&quot;?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is it measured?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you conduct yourself once you identify value?</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We will find value in players that no one else will see.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie reviews say the conflict is about intuition versus numbers. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s about knowing where the value is. It&#39;s not easy knowing where value really is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The problem is identifying where the value resides. </em>When you know where the value resides, then you manage things to bring out this value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;04-card-counters-at-the-blackjack-table.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We are card counters at the blackjack table.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">When you know where the value is, you know where your edge is. </span>You build your skills, your competency, your abilities around this edge.<span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\"> And then, you play the percentages so this value manifests.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce and LaSalleMart are about site owners, and consultants to those site owners, making money in this brutal economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce and LaSalleMart are about the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce and LaSalleMart are about making money for site owners and consultants. Not for developers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a business model for programmers. Nor for extension purveyors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s all about site owners, and consultants to those site owners, building their income and net worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s about my Members building their income and net worth by building the monthly revenue from the sites we run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Month after month after month after month followed by months and months and months of un-ending un-interrupted revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s about the money. So we talk about the money. Right off the bat, our mindset is average transactional sales and transaction volume. We want to grow the number of online sales; and, the dollar value of each online sale. We want to build up the number of revenue generating ecommerce sites under our purview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Website design. SEO. SEF. MVC. OOP. Social media. Lines of code. Number of commits. La la la la, it&#39;s just talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;01-what-is-the-problem.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are not a programmer.&nbsp; You do not devote your days to coding. That&#39;s not the business you are in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, you need to be in the programming business to cope with the open source software you use, even though programming is not your primary business. Programming may not even be on your radar of core competencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s an unfair game. But that&#39;s the game we&#39;re in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you like it or not, you are in the technology business, because technology underlies your revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week a client wants to add buyers to their MailChimp list. They have a plugin. But that plugin does not work. An update from that plugin&#39;s creator is not forthcoming. Now what? When technology fails, your revenue fails. My client is now forced to maintain that plugin himself, or find another one. Either way, my client is forced to spend time, energy, and perhaps money on this itty bitty little piece of his online business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology is expensive to create and maintain. Enormously expensive. Prohibitively expensive. Yet, creating and maintaining it are key predicates to running successful online businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I should add here that the inexorable customizing of open source software is also hugely expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes sense for consultants and site owners to band together to amortize their technology costs, and to lower their risks, amongst themselves. This is the exact behaviour my own group of clients is going through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a client, who is a consultant, who is using K2Store on one of their client&#39;s site. I have a client using Interspire on his site. I&#39;ve told both these clients just this week that neither cart is what I specialize in, and that if I am to support their sites they have to pay the full shot. I have no clients using those carts, nor will I have clients going on those carts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to feel the full weight of the risk you are truly shouldering, then feel the loneliness of being the only one using a particular cart when that carts fucks up on you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients have similar goals and challenges. It makes sense to bring them together so they can amortize their costs, and lower their risks, together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My group is not big enough to properly amortize the cost of the programming that has to be done. Which is why I&#39;m be recruiting more people into Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting back to MoneyBall... where does the true value of consultants and site-owners banding together reside?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know what the conventional thinking is: let&#39;s band together to pound out features. We need a MailChimp plugin? We&#39;ll, have someone do it, and have ten people pay for it instead of one person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I confess that I thought the real value of bringing my clients together is cost-sharing the pounding out of features that everyone needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the conventional thinking is that you buy players. Well, we buy features, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrong!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Pounding out features&quot; represents an imperfect understanding of where your profits come from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The guy&#39;s got a great glove, he&#39;s a decent leadoff hitter, he can steal bases, but is he worth $7.5 million a year?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>He&#39;s a great programmer, he&#39;s got customer service skills, he can pound out features. But, is he worth paying $1,500 for a MailChimp plugin? No!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of that MailChimp plugin is not just the actual code. You have to get that plugin on to the website. If you run 10 sites, you have to get that plugin on ten websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, MailChimp changes its API. Now, you have to modify your plugin. You have to find the code, modify it, test it, and update your ten sites. Do you know where your code is so you or someone else can modify it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key thing is the ability to put code on your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The real value resides in the software development process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s the software development process that gets the code on your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GPL open source software gives your the right to change the source code. It&#39;s true worth is having this code hoisted onto your software development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I looked at the software development process, it opened new possibilities I had not seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt; 02-buy-wins-buy-runs.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&#39;t buy features, you buy revenue. And to buy revenue, you need to buy a software development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you think of Joomla extensions, you think of the zip file&nbsp; you upload to the Joomla installer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a creator and maintainer of Joomla software, there is enormous value in getting away from the idea that you are creating one single zip file for the Joomla installer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, think of your Joomla software as lego blocks that can be put together in different ways.&nbsp; Builds, not zip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of funnelling all development efforts into creating one zip for everyone, you can simultaneously develop different builds for different people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why build a generic ecommerce extension, and then add &quot;localizations&quot; to it afterwards. Why build a genericized system of taxes that can accomodate after-market add-ons when you can just build the different taxes into the base system? By controlling the software development process, and not just controlling the code, we can do this. We can simultaneously build LaSalleMarts for Canada, all 50 American States, and for whatever other jurisdiction we choose. So, each time we release LaSalleMart, we release ten or twenty or a hundred or a thousand builds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m starting to think of the build process as an upstream and downstream process. Upstream is the code&#39;s origination. Downstream is your site. Club Commerce does the main upstream builds. You do the downstream builds to update your individual sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&#39;s not just the code, but it&#39;s the ultimate delivery of the code onto your sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an untravelled road. We have to figure out our software development process as we go along, improving as we learn. Git, GitHub.com, Assembla, Jenkins, CloudBees DevCloud, Selenium, among other things, is our starting point. An unlikely starting point from a conventional point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;05-every-at-bat-is-like-a-hand-of-blackjack.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack. Every card that is dealt your odds completely change. So every first pitch strike your batting average goes down 75 points</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If you focus on the code, and not the process, then you are already crimping your revenue and profits. You&#39;ll spend too much downstream time getting that code onto your site. You&#39;ll spend too much time doing post-coding customizations. The extra time you spend messing with installs and customizing lowers your profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;06-you-get-on-base-we-win-you-dont-we-lose.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>You get on base, we win. You don&#39;t, we lose.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>With software development processes, we design smaller projects to get code on your sites faster. It&#39;s not, ok, here&#39;s the code for that thing you wanted, now what do we do with it. Now, we know going in how we do it. We know where that code is during the entire process. We control that code during the entire process. That code undergoes tests throughout the process. And in the end that code is placed on your websites automatically -- ideally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It becomes a matter of just getting on base. Getting code to sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, right now, at the start, it&#39;s not about coding. It&#39;s about the software development process. Because, that&#39;s where the value resides. That&#39;s our edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s a long-and-getting-longer list of features to build. What we need is a way to accomplish and deploy these features, before we set to the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Less Members, Raising Subscriptions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My original idea is to form a club of 300 site owners and consultants, at a monthly subscription fee of $23.25CAD per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I&#39;m changing this. On top of my 7 Founding Members, my Club will have a maximum of 140 Members. My subscription fee is going up to $50CAD per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only do I not think 300 people are going to sign-up, but I don&#39;t think I want to deal with 300 people. Originally, I wanted 300 people to cast a wide net with user testing. However, we can compensate for the lack of human testing by implementing integration testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Moneyball way of looking at value means I can form a small elite group of consultants and site owners, run a ton of projects, produce high quality code, and get this code onto your sites so you can make more money month-after-month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The price is up so I take in the same gross after month. Without this gross, I&#39;m married to consulting which delegates my Club to a hobby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The price also reflects that my Club is not a consumer club. It&#39;s not an open-ended effort to get an unbounded number of subscribers. This is something completely different. Maybe a bit weird, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s a road less travelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This thing is not $50/month. I expect my Members to contribute at least $100/month -- or the equivalent in elbow grease. Why? Because with a kick-ass software development process, we&#39;ll be able to accomodate a lot of simultaneous projects. Which means we&#39;ll need to hire programmers. Ha! We&#39;ll be a volume operation because there&#39;s a ton of things to accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>140 of you kicking in $100 a month (probably payable directly to the programmers). That&#39;s $14,000/month in development dollars. So right off the bat we can support a number of programmers full time if we want to. That&#39;s a quarter million a year, which is major league development money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

We are creating and maintaining our Joomla ecommerce software. Wow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please look at my blog posts and listen to my podcasts to see how we got here, and see what approach I am recommending.&nbsp; Start with my recent &quot;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/lasallemart4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Moneyball of Joomla eCommerce\">The Moneyball of Joomla eCommerce</a>&quot;. Listen to this one -- I know it&#39;s tempting to just read my notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have our first sponsor. This is the time to be one of my 140 Members, to build on this. I will talk about this sponsorship later!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We really are treating open source software as Raw Material. A recurring topic of conversation is extensions that are abandoned; or, are missing a few vital features. Let&#39;s put these extensions under the LaSalleMart umbrella.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda and Joomla 2.5. What do we do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do we leave Tienda intact and convert it to Joomla 2.5 so our live sites are &quot;2.5 ready&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing so is too constraining -- why limit our options? Why not leave ourselves the opportunity to tweak Tienda along the way to Joomla 2.5? The more involved we get with Tienda, the more we want to tweak it. Frankly, I want to blow it up into smaller pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spent a massive amount of time on our Hangout talking about the features we need. We are so used to thinking of extensions as things we nibble at on the edges to get those extra features we need. But, with LaSalleMart, we are doing the entire extension. We know we need a ton of features. To get those features, we need a software development process that accomodates the creation of a ton of features. Otherwise, we&#39;ll arrive at the same frustrations we are already experiencing. We need to talk about Continuous Integration, and where exactly the huge payoff is with CI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Special thanks, as always, to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anahitapolis Blog\">Anahita Social Engine Hangout Sessions</a>&nbsp;at Anahitapolis.com, that inspired my LaSalleMart Hangouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ll give it another go next month!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Bob</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(5, 8, 3, 'Lasallemart6', '<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to my third LaSalleMart Hangout. Today is Tuedsay March 27th, 2012. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the day I was to originally publish this Hangout podcast, I saw a tweet that linked to a webinar about Continous Development. This webinar convinced me that I made a big mistake with my Club Commerce and LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mistake: I misjudged how much the idea of &quot;Continuous Development&quot; is actually accepted in the programming community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This webinar opened my eyes that the idea of &quot;Continuous Development&quot; is not a marginalized concept in the programming community like I thought; but, is, rather, a legimate idea that is gaining a lot of acceptance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wpview-wrap\" style=\"width: 579.9375px; position: relative; clear: both; -webkit-user-select: none; margin-bottom: 16px; border: 1px solid transparent; font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', \'Bitstream Charter\', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb0PzjGq4AI\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', \'Bitstream Charter\', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 75px;\">(jump to Continuous Development animation, concludes part one, introduces Andy Singleton -- see slide @ 43:13)</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2010/tbbs12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"GIT on with Source Code Repositories with Andy Singleton\">interviewed Andy Singleton two years ago</a>. He founded his high-end code-in-the-cloud site called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://assembla.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Assembla.com\">Assembla.com</a>, a site whose progress I&#39;ve been following since that interview. When I saw this webinar, I realized that, well, of course he&#39;d be figuring out how to use Continuous Development for his site. He is aggressive about using new techniques for himself and for his subscribers, so of course he would be figuring out how to use Continuous Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What he discovered, which is in in the webinar&#39;s Youtube video,&nbsp; is that&nbsp;<strong>he gets features to his site faster using &quot;Continuous&quot; ideas</strong>. This is, ultimately, the message that is getting out to the programming community, and we should be taking note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question about using Continuous Development techniques and technology is not &quot;why?&quot;, but &quot;why not?&quot;. But, the real question that programmers are asking is &quot;how?&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only has Andy started using Continuous Development for his own site, but he is creating Continuous Development features in his site for us to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that Club Commerce is a far more compelling proposition than I thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here I am thinking that I have to sell you on the Continuous Integration and Continuous Development ideas. Oh no, the adoption of the &quot;Continuous&quot; ideas are too far along for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology, techniques and programmer acceptance have come together and now it&#39;s time for us to get to it ourselves. The smart money is figuring out how the techniques&nbsp; work for them, as the technology is still in the early stage. The early adopters are going through the not-insignificant pain of figuring things out for themselves, because the money potential from being first adopters is enormously huge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Club Commerce and LaSalleMart are hot ideas whose time has come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla consultants and site owners are better off signing up for the $50CDN/month (join&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallecommerce.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=level&amp;Itemid=217\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Join my Club Commerce\">here</a>), to get a piece of this action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current ways of Joomla ecommerce are good to have now. But end-user site owners, and consultants to site owners, using Continuous Development, controlling their own software development, is the thing of the future. If you don&#39;t get a piece of this action, you will risk what you have, sooner than you think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s better to screw up and learn, then to sit back and read how others did it later, because the ones who figure it out will get more features onto their live Joomla ecommerce sites faster, and more often, then anyone else has every done it. With these features, our live sites will make even more revenue, a portion of which we can re-invest into new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, considering my mistake, I re-did this very special Hangout podcast...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hangouts are private conference calls with my Club Commerce Members, published publicly as a podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my Limited Membership Club where site owners, and consultants to site owners, create and maintain Joomla ecommerce technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is the name of the Joomla ecommerce technology that we create inside Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hangouts are published on the third Thursday of the month, and are inspired by the groundbreaking&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2012/01/how-we-wrapped-up-2011/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"How We Wrapped Up 2011 at Anahitapolis.com\">Anahitapolis.com Hangouts</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this month&#39;s Hangout I turned off the Skype recorder, as my Founding Members and I have not talked enough about Club Commerce and LaSalleMart amongst ourselves, so I am using this Hangout as an opportunity to host private conversations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of one big conference call, what ended up happening was a series of one-on-one chats with my Founding Members. I spent 2-1/2 hours chatting with Founding Club Commerce Member Zach Atkinson (<a href=\"http://machineandmagic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Machine and Magic\">MachineAndMagic.com</a>) during our regularly scheduled Hangout time-slot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had quite a conversation. In a very nice way, Zach put me on the spot to explain myself. Including, why Club Membership has not grown beyond our Founding Membership; and, why I am pursuing LaSalleMart in the way that I am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as I know, I am the most prolific and consistent blogger in the Joomla world. I started this Media site in early 2010, and now I&#39;m on my 50th &quot;The Bob Bloom Show&quot; podcast; and, I have about 30 additional podcasts. All are available on iTunes, and on this site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ideas underlying my Club Commerce and LaSalleMart are explained in my podcasts, and augmented in my blog posts. You can trace my journey from 2010. Club Commerce and LaSalleMart are hardly start-up ideas &quot;du jour&quot;. These ideas have spent a long time evolving and taking root.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla ecommerce site owners and consultants: you are not going to learn how to succeed with Joomla ecommerce&nbsp; reading the<a href=\"http://hbr.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Harvard Business Review\">&nbsp;Harvard Business Review</a>. We have to blaze a trail ourselves, and write the book ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to blaze a trail because we have no choice. The current doctrines and practices are not working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are frustrated with Joomla ecommerce, if you are a site owner or a consultant, if you want to stick with Joomla, then Follow Me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you make a point of having your fingers in different technology pies, then Follow Me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The money fee is a nominal ($50CDN/month), because it is designed to be nominal, so you can be on the inside. You are not required to expend herculean efforts once inside. The payoff will be huge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need a way to get features on to our live websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is this so important? Because we make money with features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can build an airplane that flies. But, can we build a fleet of aircraft? One or two planes in the sky is not going to do us any good. We need to build aircraft in volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone thinks it&#39;s about writing code. It is not about writing code! From the Moneyball movie:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s an unfair game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only we are not programmers, but we don&#39;t have the money to run our own I.T. departments. And even if we had money for in-house I.T., the investment required to create and maintain the ecommerce features we need is gi-normous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only are our sites&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;making the&nbsp; revenues they should, but we are&nbsp;<em>losing the&nbsp;</em><em>compound</em>&nbsp;effect of that lost revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We lack features that would produce more online revenue, so we do not make that money. Then, we don&#39;t have that extra money to reinvest into more features that will make us more money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think we need code, and so we think we need coders. But what we really need are features on our site. You&#39;d think that more coders bring us more features. Night follows day, but more coders do not always produce more features for our sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;02-buy-wins-buy-runs.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We over-emphasize coding, and we under-emphasize the entire software development process. As consultants and site owners, we usually don&#39;t even care about the development process. But we should. We certainly pay the price for lousy software development processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shouldn&#39;t buy players, we should buy runs. We shouldn&#39;t buy coders, we should buy features. Why? Because we make money with features, not with coders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do we win an unfair game?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate answer is for us end users to band together, for us end users to pool our money and talents, and for us end users to create/maintain our own Joomla ecommerce technology for ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coding, on its own, represents an imperfect understanding of where revenue comes from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Value is not with the code. Value resides in how that code is created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way to unlock that value is for us end users to grab the software development process by the balls, and jump all over Continuous Development techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuous Development is at the stage where it is less risky trying it out than ignoring it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we don&#39;t get into it, someone else will. And we&#39;ll have lost the advantage of knowledge and skill in a relatively new, highly specialized technical area, that has explosive profit potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are not alone, nor are we unique, in our need of a never ending river of features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his webinar, Andy Singleton of Assembla.com says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;2012mar15_assembla_webinar_good_results.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 42:30, Andy says:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>each feature set is delivered faster, which is a&nbsp;<em>mathematical certainty</em>&nbsp;because&nbsp;<em>nothing has to wait</em>&nbsp;until the next release time</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another top SaaS site that does code-in-the-cloud is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"GitHub.com\">GitHub.com</a>. An article about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"GitHub Flow \">GitHub.com&#39;s software development process</a>&nbsp;says:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>... we don&rsquo;t really have &#39;releases&#39; because we&nbsp;<em>deploy to production every day</em>&nbsp;- often several times a day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Deploy to production several times a day? Did someone actually write that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of putting features onto your live site continuously is not only considered a sane idea; but, some are doing this very thing today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in the Joomla world, the Joomla Platform project is using Continuous Integration (see my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallecommerce.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=87:testing-value-galore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Testing: Value Galore\">blog post about this</a>); and, the<a href=\"http://squareonecms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Square One Joomla Distro \">&nbsp;SquareOneCMS</a>&nbsp;Joomla Distro is using CI ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are in a unique position to achieve Continuous Development, because we have our live websites. Extension purveyors cannot deliver Continuous Development because they do not control our live websites. Their development stops at the Joomla installer, which we control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, Joomla ecommerce consultants and site owners, are better off taking control of the entire software development process rather than dabbling in it piecemeal as we are doing now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Better that we organize ourselves, pool our talents and resources, figure out Continuous Development techniques and technology that work for us, run small Feature projects, and ladle on the features we need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using &quot;Continuous&quot; processes means you need to learn and use new technologies. But, this is the Moneyball aspect, w<em>here we focus on developing skills where the value is, and then let that value manifest</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My plan is simple: I want a Club that has money-making sites under the care of my Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$100 a month, $10,000 a month, it&#39;s all good. We succeed together, we grow together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Club with too many Members becomes unwieldy, and loses a certain intimacy. A Membership of 1,000 paying $5 monthly is counter-productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Club with too few Members invites proprietary behaviour, where Members prefer to keep all the good juicy technology for themselves -- even from me! Non-competition and non-disclosure agreements not good for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why did I reject the traditional Joomla development approaches? Because they are not producing the volume of ecommerce features we yearn for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No sense copying traditional approaches, and then ending up with the same frustrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Better to travel a road less travelled, and end up with different frustrations!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially if we can get more features to our sites, and work through the growing pains, it&#39;s a better road. At which point, we can create proof-of-concepts to move into Joomla mobile ecommerce -- the thinking and Joomla ecomm technology about mobile is so medieval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the Toronto Joomla User Group, I know outstanding Joomla professionals. Some of whom are my Founding Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am looking forward to getting to know 140 more outstanding Joomla ecommerce professionals. Connecting, working together, sharing ideas, doing projects, celebrating successes -- I know this new phase of my professional life will be very satisfying, one that I will be very proud of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is to dive into the details, and simulate, Continuous Development environments. We will de-construct Tienda into discrete pieces, to accomodate our new processes. Simultaneous to this will be initial feature planning. Zach will critique my initial plan, and then it will got to Members for discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

My instincts were bang on, because it was quite an intense experience getting the very first LaSalleMart done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I&#39;ll tell you something, it is an immensely satisfying experience under my belt. Especially so because putting theories into practice have far exceeded my expectations. A rare experience that the reality exceeds the expectation, from which I draw a few conclusions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I am absolutely, positively, completely right about all the stuff I&#39;ve been blogging and podcasting about;</li>\r\n	<li>My proposition to Joomla consultants has now progressed to the point where Membership in my Club Commerce is the lower risk;</li>\r\n	<li>I&#39;m not changing a thing about my Club Commerce and LaSalleMart concepts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you something else: if you think that the older I get, the more my rough edges are smoothing out, forget it. I&#39;m as full as piss and vinegar and ambition as I ever was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, developing Joomla ecommerce the Club Commerce way is the red hot way for users to go about it. Whatever growing pains my Members and I will have to endure, it&#39;ll be worth it, as we grow into 300 Members. I have zero doubts whatsoever that with 300 Club Commerce Members just like my kick-ass Founding Tribe, the sky is the limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will tell you why I&#39;m onto something red scorching hot. But first, let&#39;s get up-to-date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is the name of the Joomla ecommerce technology produced by my Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve kick-started LaSalleMart 1.0 to get it out the door.&nbsp; A special thank you to Founding Tribe Member, Zach Atkinson, who kicked my butt to package my Tienda handiwork into the inaugural version of LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is a fork of Tienda 0.8.2.&nbsp; LaSalleMart is nearly 100% Tienda. I&#39;ve changed practically zero of anything in Tienda. I&#39;m not hiding this fact. However, there are differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would say that the big difference between LaSalleMart and Tienda is that a consultant actually took a big monolithic Joomla cart extension and forked the fucker successfully. What, you think I&#39;m a programmer. Hell no, baby! I&#39;m a consultant with technical skills, but I&#39;m a user. A lowly user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if there&#39;s one difference between LaSalleMart and Tienda, it&#39;s that a lowly user succeeded forking it. I did global search-and-replaces to substitute the word &quot;LaSallemart&quot; with &quot;Tienda&quot;, which was a lot trickier than I imagined. I yanked out the generic tax calculation and dropped in my Canadian and California tax programs. I performed surgery on the checkout. I cleaned up, slightly, the config.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And guess what? I&#39;m not alone. Zach is working very hard on the first LaSalleMart live site. In so doing, his user testing has improved the quality of LaSalleMart. There&#39;s a Canadian-only tweak to a product details setting. He&#39;s uncovered some weirdness with product attributes that we&#39;re still working on. We found a bizarre quantity problem in the base checkout that took me an entire working day to uncover and fix. LaSalleMart is not hobby effort or a flight of fancy. It&#39;s real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having gone through the intense experience of putting LaSalleMart 1.0 together, I think to myself that I should have done this much earlier. But, I&#39;ll tell you something. Having explained my approach in such detail in my blog and my podcasts, communicating to you what I have in mind, enumerating the vastly different way in which I want to approach software development, and pounding away over and over that the user perspective is a key element in achieving user-specific objectives, I ended up with such a solid vision that I was able to apply this vision in putting together LaSalleMart 1.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My vision is nothing more than a pissed-off angry consultant who is told over and over again by extension purveyors to change the code myself. Well, I did. Not only did I change the code myself, but I did it with my distinct user perspective. Having sat down and actually translated my vision into a tangible and concrete cart extension, and succeeded -- well, it blows my mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel like Joe Namath talking about his Super Bowl III victory: We Did It!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, a user, not an extension purveyor, forked a massive monolithic cart extension. And I have this message to my Joomla ecommerce user peers: follow me -- join my Club Commerce. Users banding together to create and maintain our own software opens up tremendous opportunities for those users who are banding together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one overt difference between Tienda and LaSalleMart. My LaSalleMart comes in three simultaneous editions: a Canadian edition, a California edition, and a Regular edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are fully functional editions. These are not versions with different feature sets, and you have to pay tiered rates to get the different feature sets. No, these are fully functional. The Canadian edition has my HST/PST/GST tax component built right into the core. Same with the Cali edition, which springs from a California tax component I created for Tienda at the behest of a very dear consultant who lives near Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to creating these three simultaneous full featured LaSalleMart editions is a build tool called&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://phing.info/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Phing website\">Phing</a>. Phing is something you&#39;ve never heard of, but every single PHP programmer, especially every single Joomla programmer, knows about it. And probably uses. Phing is widely accepted, very mainstream, very established. It is also exceptionally powerful, and it forever changes the way I think of constructing a Joomla site. Using Phing with the Continuous Integration server called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jenkins-ci.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jenkins CI\">Jenkins</a>&nbsp;has serious revenue potential for users. The kind of potential that would have us huddled over envelops and napkins, beers forgotten, at the Joomla meet-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to know something? I&#39;ve never used Phing before putting LaSalleMart together. I had the concept, and I chose Phing to bring the concept to life. I took to Phing right away, and in half a week built 7 Phing scripts to create my three simultaneous LaSalleMart editions. There is no code duplication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a fundamental difference between me and you, and extension purveyors. We have the live websites. Us users to vertically integrating into software development represents a massive fundamental opportunities to make money. LaSalleMart 1.0 is a huge proof-of-concept that these opportunities are real; and, that exploiting these opportunities is very possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting back to LaSalleMart 1.0, I disabled guest checkout because it does not work. This is something we will re-visit within my Club. I cleaned up checkout by returning it into a back-to-basics step-by-step&nbsp; checkout. The code underneath is cleaner, and provides a great base from which to modify. I modified the config to align with the changes I made. No way I was going to release LaSalleMart with Tienda&#39;s checkout left as-is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart uses Live Update by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://akeebabackup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AkeebaBackup.com\">Akeeba Backup</a>. Which does not work yet, as I decided to press on with my launch, and then finish up my Live Update implementation. Live Update lets you get my upgrades from the Administrator with a couple of clicks. Which is necessary now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Live Update is done, next is finishing my new Canada Post shipping plugin. Then, I have PayPal Pro tweaks to do. But, before I complete my Live Update implementation, I have to work on a product attribute problem Zach&#39;s uncovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once all this is wrapped up, we have to get into Joomla 2.5 conversion. I don&#39;t think we should do a straight conversion. But, this is a discussion to have in my Members-only site, as there are many issues involved -- many! We&#39;ll be talking about this on future LaSalleMart News podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, let&#39;s wrap this up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recap...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 1.0 is done in three simultaneous editions: Canada, California, and Regular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating editions for other states -- I think Illinois and Florida have dual tax rates like some provinces -- should not be a big deal since we now have base code and build scripts. As the need arises, we can do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is the only Joomla cart extension made in Canada by Canadians. My Fellow Canadians should take note!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is the only one of two Joomla cart extensions made in North America -- as far as I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is a fork of Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes this fork different from other forks is that a user did it. In so doing, a very distinctive user perspective imbues this fork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In forking Tienda,&nbsp; I learn something that I suspected: that users are screwing themselves by not taking the open source software -- and the software development process -- by the balls. Business opportunities open up like a new vista on the horizon when users vertically integrate into the technology end. You will never -- ev-ah! -- look at Joomla the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, while forking Tienda, I visited the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Free Software Licence\">GPL Licence website</a>&nbsp;over and over again -- this is the Joomla software licence -- and each time am blown away by what it says. Users just like&nbsp; you have immense inherent powers. Users banding together to harness our inherent powers makes sense. It is better to have banded together and lost, then to not band together at all, because the upside is simply too enormous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you suffer the slings and arrows of the first Joomla ecommerce User Club because it could help you double or triple your income? If this Club for Users, run by a User, had professionals just like you as Members, would that make you feel better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is not a means of selling LaSalleMart via mass marketed subscriptions. Club Commerce is a real Club. I&#39;m not running a consumer oriented operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is $36 Canadian per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members are expected to participate in some way in creating/maintaining software, including chipping-in $100/month to pay for programmers. I mean, after all, mine is a Club where Members create and maintain Joomla ecomm technology for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(7, 11, 3, 'Lasallemart9', '<p>Welcome to my ninth &quot;LaSalleMart&quot; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of each month, almost, I publish an update about LaSalleMart and Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I am combining both into this podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello, my name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Wednesday September 19, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My flagship podcast, &quot;The Bob Bloom Show&quot;, is on hiatus. It will return, but right now my focus is LaSalleMart and Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s podcast is also a video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MVcCpVDc32c\" width=\"400\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 1.0 is a fork of Tienda 0.8.2, and works on Joomla 1.5 only. There are differences between Tienda and LaSalleMart -- LaSalleMart has already diverged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second LaSalleMart Canada site just went live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Entrepreneurship is an absolutely different experience living it than reading about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This summer I experienced my own entrepreneurship profoundly. Profoundly because my entrepreneurship seems like a big stinking failure. Yeah, a big stinking failure!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&#39;s what living my entrepreneurship&#39;s been: a heap of self doubt sprinkled by a lack of results. Molasses pours faster, and grass grows faster, than has my Club Commerce&#39;s progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always had this romantic vision of entrepreneurship, but the reality for me is a daily grind of persistence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you a deep dark secret: I expected to be pounding the pavement this month, creating a job for myself by finding an outfit attracted to my LaSalleMart charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My entrepreneurship seems to have come down to being enough of a man to know when to quit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preparation for quitting entrepreneurship, and to create a job for myself -- which ironically seems an entrepreneurial endeavour -- I knew I had to learn more technical skills. The very same set of skills that I needed for my here-to-fore entrepreneurial efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I dove into learning software development. Development environments, software repositories, agile methodologies, build scripts, testing -- the whole ball of wax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of it felt like stuff I did as a corporate IT business analyst. It wasn&#39;t completely foreign; plus, I&#39;ve been keeping up with this stuff for a while. It was a matter of diving into the technicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, but what a grinding, frustrating dive it was this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning by reformatting. How many times did I reformat Ubuntu?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning by frustration. An absolutely grinding, frustrating experience. Command line installs, varied instructions, limitless parameters, countless package installs. It was a long while before I finally, actually, got to my PhpStorm install.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frustration peaked, and then peaked again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was diving into pain. And the more I dove, the more painful it got. The more I learned, the more I realized how vast is the learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the midst of all this came a custom Joomla programming gig. Using my new set-up and the Akeeba Framework-on-Framework, and focused on a real project, my learning slowly took hold. Slowly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it was that I persisted through this grinding frustration. And by being deeply in it, emerging on the other side, I realized something completely amazing: I am right!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What had started as a entrepreneurial capitulation turned into a transformation into confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>A funny thing happened to me on the way to using Assembla.com, a wonderful code-in-the-cloud website. Its software repositories do not integrate with PhpStorm, my full featured source code editor. Manually compensating for this lack of integration slowed me down so much that I did something I did not want to do: look for an alternative to Assembla.com. Knowing about Atlassian.com was a Big Help when I saw that it&#39;s repository site, BitBucket.com, does integrate with PhpStorm. And that&#39;s how I ended up at Atlassian.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&#39;s how I found their blog posts, &quot;Story Branching and Continuous Integration: a swords-to-plowshares tale&quot; (http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/07/feature-branching-continuous-integrationgit-bamboo/); and, &quot;Using GreenHopper to Automate Bamboo &amp; Bitbucket (&ldquo;What the whaaaa?&hellip;&rdquo;)&quot; (http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/08/automatic-git-branch-jira-greenhopper-bamboo/). These recent articles enumerate how-to use their suite of software to achieve true continuous delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in so doing, my interpretation, has spun the phrase &quot;The medium is the message&quot; with a new spin: the process is the software. Which I defer to a special future &quot;The Bob Bloom Show&quot; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, you know something? The shoe&#39;s on the other foot. &quot;Continuous&quot; is the trend, and it is coming on at full speed with full force. What I thought was a ways off is smacking us all in the face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My idea that a bunch of consultants and site owners -- us lowly users -- would band together to harness Continuous technologies and methods is brilliant. You know, if I say so myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, hadn&#39;t I just immersed myself in this stuff, and found it to be ceaselessly technical? You bet your ass it&#39;s techical! And therein lies the barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You think some guy in Toronto blogging about continuous software development being &quot;The Moneyball of Coding&quot; is simply making an ass of himself. Hey, me more than anyone. The entrepreneur articles wax poetic about being visionary, but the reality is no one likes a smart ass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, guess what, my fellow consulting brethern and site owner clients: you&#39;re fucked and you don&#39;t even know it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the owner of the Boston Red Sox told Billy Beane at the end of the Moneyball movie, if teams aren&#39;t tearing apart how they do baseball, they should be. Or, they&#39;ll be watching the Boston Red Sox win the World Series, which I will add they actually did, to the consternation of this Blue Jays fan!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not struggling to figure out how you are going to immerse your website in the continuous software development process, you will be left behind. Because your competition will be struggling with it, and so will figure out how to harness its competitive powers; and, they will eat you for breakfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Continuous software development is going to obsolete code at a breathtaking pace, and you are going to be fucked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The success predicate is the ability to create code, not to consume it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>At the beginning of the summer, I convinced myself that I&#39;m nuts in the head yammering on about the difference between creating code and consuming it. By Labour Day, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consultants and site owners -- users! -- banding together to create code becomes a way to survive and thrive in a continuous world. Pooling resources, creating a critical mass of money and expertise, to create code delivered continuously, is the logical response to the challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y&#39;know, my clients don&#39;t run cookie cutter websites. These site zig and zag. Requirements change. Smart active people are running active sites. o.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I didn&#39;t feel affirmed enough, Assembla.com posted after Labour Day &quot;Continous Delivery and Scalable Agile - Find Out The Secret&quot; (http://blog.assembla.com/assemblablog/tabid/12618/bid/87901/Continuous-Delivery-and-Scalable-Agile-Find-Out-the-Secret.aspx). Here&#39;s what its Founder writes:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;...Facebook recently announced that they are releasing changes twice per day, and every week they release code from 600 engineers. Even if you don&rsquo;t have the same resources as Facebook, you can have a release process that is just as fast and effective. Six months ago, we were releasing once every four weeks, and as our system got more complicated, the release cycle got slower, and we spent more time patching production bugs after each release. Now we release every day, or many times per day, with fewer bugs. It&rsquo;s a vast improvement. It didn&rsquo;t come naturally. We had to figure out the process secret, which I can now share with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The secret ingredient is the location where you test your new code prior to release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical software release process looks like the diagram below. Developers have been using this pattern for at least 50 years. They merge all of their changes together, and then they test the &ldquo;release candidate&rdquo; to make sure everything works. They iterate this process until they have a release candidate that looks bug free. Then, they release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...A continuous release process uses a different test pattern... if you use this process, you can release anytime... One of our biggest challenges was creating an on-demand test environment. However, this accelerates our work because developers can get test systems on-demand, rather than waiting for a slot in a shared QA environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...In almost every successful continuous release process, the &ldquo;QA&rdquo; box is partly occupied by automated tests, written by developers, that run &ldquo;continuous integration&rdquo; when each set of changes is merged. For example, we configured Jenkins to run tests on each change and &ldquo;downvote&rdquo; changes that don&rsquo;t pass all tests. I&rsquo;ll write about continuous integration in a future article.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&quot;Developers have been using this pattern for at least 50 years&quot;. But now this pattern is obsoleting, right before our eyes. You understand that it&#39;s happening right now.<br />\r\nBanding together now is a pathway to remaining competitive; is a means to control the software you use as opposed to being at the mercy of SaaS sites; and is a gateway to innovation that will keep you ahead of your competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you going to consume software or create it. Consumers to the left, keep walking. Consultants and site owners who want to create it, contact me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>So, I am not folding my tent. After a few weeks of client work, I am going heads-down continuing my LaSalleMart conversion to Joomla 2.5. This is the priority, as this conversion is proving to be quite the bottleneck to broader progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(8, 12, 3, 'Lasallemart10', '<p>Welcome to my tenth &ldquo;LaSalleMart&rdquo; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello, my name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Monday October 15th, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These podcasts are devoted to my LaSalleMart ecommerce extension for Joomla, and to my Club Commerce subscription site for LaSallemart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing I want to do is announce that&nbsp;<strong>LaSalleMart 2.0 for Joomla 2.5 is a reality.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 will be out by Friday, October 26th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not want a full month to pass before communicating what I am up to. Regular communications is important, so I am &nbsp; taking a break from development to get you up to date. Better that you know that at least in the first 2 weeks of the month you will see a &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast from me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silence is always the worst response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late September, whilst converting LaSalleMart 1.0 to Joomla 2.5, I saw&nbsp;a link on the Dioscouri download site &nbsp;&quot;<strong>tienda_v0-10-0-alpha.zip</strong>&quot;. I fired up a fresh Joomla 2.5 site, loaded this download as-is, and took it for a little spin. I was able to navigate the admin screens, and this was enough for me to ponder a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should I continue converting LaSalleMart 1.0 to Joomla 2.5; or, should I refork Tienda for Joomla 2.5 from scratch? Hands down,&nbsp;<strong>refork</strong>. Why? Speed. So, I&#39;ve been reforking Tienda, and have succeeded in creating a Core-only package for LaSalleMart 2.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This&nbsp;<strong>core package is already installed on a client site</strong>, and is undergoing user testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been a lot faster this time around, mainly because I have code. As well, I have a ton more experience with builds and source code repositories, so my software builds are much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a<strong>&nbsp;honking big difference</strong>&nbsp;between Tienda for Joomla 2.5 and the previous Tienda: the new Tienda has a&nbsp;<strong>library</strong>&nbsp;in the Joomla /libraries/ folder. This is fabulous, I really like this new library. Taking some code out of the extension and into a library -- yeah baby!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the installation routine is now mostly in the library, for what seems like an effort to genericize all Dioscouri extension installs. Nothing wrong with this, but for LaSalleMart I just lopped off all this install code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hook between the extension and the library has not been smooth during the re-fork. There&#39;s another disconnection just reported by my client, which is not entirely unexpected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuous deployment and multiple packages are key goals of LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To set the table, I&nbsp;<strong>busted up the Tienda zip file</strong>&nbsp;into 61 separate installable zip files. There is an extension zip, a library zip, a system plugin for the library, 19 modules, and 39 plugins.&nbsp;Each has its own repository. There are 69 build files to put it all together. The only way to install &#39;em is via the Joomla installer. A typical install will only use 10 to 15 zip files, so no need to worry about installing 61 separate zips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the lego blocks of code, we have a way of putting these lego blocks together in whatever form we desire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately up is the creation of a Canadian and Californian LaSalleMart package. Setting up the LaSalleMart code into lego blocks makes this packaging possible. So, by October 26th there will be three simultaneous LaSalleMart packages: Canada, California, and Standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many people who will yearn for the all-in-one installation; but, you will receive no satisfaction with LaSalleMart. We&#39;re doing it differently here, not to be different, but to modernize. It&#39;s not a marketing gimmick. It&#39;s a technical thing. If and when we do an installation routine, it will likely be a full blown extension that supports package management</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deb Cinkus led a terrific session about choosing a Joomla ecommerce extension at last month&#39;s JoomlaDay Chicago:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3CkgH6ahE8g\" width=\"400\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deb enumerates the things people typically look for in a Joomla ecommerce extension (approx five minute mark) :</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>features</li>\r\n	<li>community</li>\r\n	<li>eco-system</li>\r\n	<li>core support</li>\r\n	<li>documentation</li>\r\n	<li>maturity of the release</li>\r\n	<li>third party extensions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The philosophy behind LaSalleMart is different. It&#39;s not about serving consumers of software. Rather,&nbsp;<strong>the philosophy is of producing software. Everyone using LaSalleMart, regardless of technical proficiency, is in it as a software producer</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This philosophy is not shared by the majority of Joomla ecommerce users, which is fine by me. However, the reality is that this really is the philosophy behind LaSalleMart, and it will not change.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>[@ 1:50] Yes, there were times, I&#39;m sure you knew<br />\r\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew<br />\r\nBut through it all, when there was doubt<br />\r\nI ate it up and spit it out<br />\r\nI faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve loved, I&#39;ve laughed and cried<br />\r\nI&#39;ve had my fill, my share of losing<br />\r\nAnd now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing<br />\r\nTo think I did all that<br />\r\nAnd may I say, not in a shy way,<br />\r\n&quot;Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For what is a man, what has he got?<br />\r\nIf not himself, then he has naught<br />\r\nTo say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels<br />\r\nThe record shows I took the blows and did it my way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, it was my way</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR_NwNR9vTc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>There exists a sub-set of Joomla ecommerce consultants and site owners who will advance their businesses by belonging to a group that produces Joomla ecommerce software. It is this group who will be attracted to LaSalleMart and Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This different focus is not a marketing gimmick to position LaSalleMart differently than the other Joomla ecomm extensions. There is tremendous value being software producers, not consumers. Unlocking this value requires different technical imperatives. The reason for the lack of installation ease is purely technical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Tienda version I forked is an alpha release, the code just feels better. The twin simultaneous exercises of converting to Joomla 2.5 and creating a library seems to have helped the codebase. Looks like Tienda 0.9 was used as the basis for conversion so that&#39;s a plus too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although LaSalleMart 2.0 is a fork of alpha software, it&#39;s based on established and cleaned &nbsp;up code. It&#39;s a matter of taking it through its paces and ironing out any rough edges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, there&#39;s a caveat: I assume that some features are still not fully fleshed out. The basic features are covered, of that I am confident. But some features are probably less so, and those features will likely get amputated as we discover them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>During the re-fork, I did the following</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>set the initial parameters to my liking;</li>\r\n	<li>added Canadian currency in the initial set-up;</li>\r\n	<li>deleted Joomla 1.5 code &nbsp;when I came upon obvious opportunities to do so;</li>\r\n	<li>deleted the link back to my website;</li>\r\n	<li>changed the extension hooks to the library -- more work to do on this;</li>\r\n	<li>deleted code that integrates with other Dioscouri extensions;</li>\r\n	<li>deleted the administrator footer and added by own custom footer;</li>\r\n	<li>modified the file headers;</li>\r\n	<li>added Live Update to the extension only;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh... I forgot in my original list:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>delete bug report plugin;</li>\r\n	<li>update manifest xml for modules and plugins for use in Joomla 2.5 only;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Live Update is part of the Akeeba Release System available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://akeebabackup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Akeeba Backup website\">Akeeba.com</a>. Although LU exists in the extension, it&#39;s not connected to the server end. I will connect all three LaSalleMart packages properly to my LU server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LU is not made for modules and plugins, although I&#39;m sure it could be. However, in the interest of speed, I will enable regular Joomla 2.5 updates for all library, modules and plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I have the packages and updates done, I will delete all remaining Joomla 1.5 code. Then, I will take the code through some paces and update accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the launch,&nbsp;<strong>I will start&nbsp;my own version of the Square One Distro</strong>. This project, now defunct, created a Joomla distribution. In order to create full Joomla packages of LaSalleMart, I need to maintain my own version of Joomla with which to base my distros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will report on this in my next LaSalleMart News podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am doing something different with LaSalleMart 2.0 than I did with version 1.0: I am releasing it for&nbsp;<strong>free</strong>.&nbsp;At this time, I am 90% sure that this means that I am releasing all my LaSalleMart packages for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for releasing free is my experience with LaSalleMart 1.0, which was a mysterious extension because it was no where to be found, except inside my subscription site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once there are some installs, I will look at listing LaSalleMart on the JED. I&#39;m not in a rush, but in due time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Updates and support are via paid subscription only.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart and Club Commerce will appeal to the few, not to the many. Which is how I prefer it actually. You are not just a subscriber on the tail end of a ticket system. In fact, I have no ticket system. No forums either. My support site is built with Anahita, a social site platform. The whole feel is different. You get to know your peers. You can go off topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My guess is that membership will top out at 300. Tiny when compared to other outfits. And that&#39;s just what I&#39;m aiming for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I expect to announce the immediate availability of multiple LaSalleMart packages on Monday October 29th. That gives me the weekend!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(9, 13, 3, 'Lasallemart11', '<p>Welcome to my November 2012 &nbsp;&ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello, my name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Friday, November 09th, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; is my monthly update about LaSalleMart and Club Commerce, published at the top of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce extension for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my limited membership site for my consulting peers, and for technically oriented site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s topics are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>new website;</li>\r\n	<li>packages available today;</li>\r\n	<li>Joomla distro;</li>\r\n	<li>development on-deck;</li>\r\n	<li>quick hits.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Website:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is an extension without a website, until now. LaSalleMart.com now has a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simplicity is what I am going for, so downloads available for everyone are on the home page, with links to my suite of sites listed on the right sidebar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downloads available for everyone require no registration, and the download links are direct one-shot single clickers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LaSalleMart packages are available today:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 for Joomla 2.5 is released today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is a fork of the Joomla 2.5 &quot;alpha&quot; version of Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major difference is with the back office -- the thing you don&#39;t see. I busted up the massive Tienda installable zip file into its individual pieces, and then created a more-work-than-I-thought build process to auto-magically create -- and &nbsp;deliver to you -- 60-odd individual Joomla components, modules, plugins, and the new library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Installation is now back-to-the-future, where you have to install the individual pieces that you need. I deleted the entire Tienda installation routine, lock stock and barrel. I deleted it in line with the fundamental philosophy underlying LaSalleMart, so there is no nicey-nicey installation routine coming on the horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An immediate benefit to busting up the mega-zip is bringing to &nbsp;you 10 simultaneous full featured LaSalleMart packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Available to Everyone:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>California</li>\r\n	<li>Canada</li>\r\n	<li>Florida</li>\r\n	<li>North Carolina</li>\r\n	<li>Standard (non-localized)</li>\r\n	<li>Library</li>\r\n	<li>Modules</li>\r\n	<li>Plugins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Available for Club Commerce Members only:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>California</li>\r\n	<li>Canada</li>\r\n	<li>Florida</li>\r\n	<li>North Carolina</li>\r\n	<li>Standard (non-localized)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the free and paid versions are identical, the only time this may be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My downloads that are available to everyone &nbsp;come with no support of any kind: no forum, no tickets, no bug reporting, no documentation, and with just a whisper of installation instructions. More on this coming up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paid components have the Akeeba Live Update installed. The free components use the Joomla Updater. The plugins, library and modules as yet have neither, but plans are to get &#39;em on either Live Update or the Joomla Updater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, I can get fixes/updates for the LaSalleMart component to you within minutes of the source code commit. Especially for the paid version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Joomla Distro:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It became clear early on into the forking process (there needs to be a better word for it) that maintaining a custom version of Joomla is a critical aspect of LaSalleMart. More precisely, this need was identified prior to forking; but, what started coming through was the need to get cracking immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were two immediate indications: the user plugin should be phased out in lieu of heretofore sancrosanct modification of Joomla&#39;s core to satisfy LaSalleMart&#39;s user management needs; and, the brand new library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Longer term, the goal is to remove the add-on-ish feel of LaSalleMart, in order to present to buyers and site owners a unified Joomla-LaSalleMart whole. To achieve this integration, it is imperative to maintain a custom Joomla version -- aka &quot;Distro&quot; (long form: Distribution).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Busting up the mega-zip file proved to be along the same lines as maintaining a custom Joomla distro because getting Joomla leaner and meaner is the same exercise. It&#39;s also a more involved exercise than I anticipated - surprise! There is still mega-zip busting work to be done, which will be done in conjunction with work on my custom Joomla distro. I do have a basic Joomla distro done, but it needs more work before there is any LaSalleMart integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The now defunct Square One Joomla Distro project accomplished a lot en route to becoming the first publicly available &nbsp;Joomla Distro (well, first one that I know of). My Joomla distro is not as ambitious, in part because my scope is narrower. However, I will make my Joomla distro available to the public, including putting it on GitHug.com to faciliate pull requests -- if any manifest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Development on-deck:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a lot of development on deck. In a way, now that we are kicking off LaSalleMart, the fun is just beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The packages need an initial round of user testing because they are very raw. I am arranging to have each &quot;flavour&quot; of LaSalleMart tested by my consulting peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, there are three Canadian site installs ready-to-go. The pressure of going live helped LaSalleMart 1.0, and so will help LaSalleMart 2.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a nice little list of post-launch tweaks to do, as part of the initial user testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing the custom Joomla distro to fruition on GitHub is a priority, with a little bit being done daily towards this goal. In conjunction is making each LaSalleMart plugin and module (and the library) updatable via the Joomla Updater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Form layouts, feedback on local tax handling, custom step-by-step checkout, and integrating user registration and address handling with Joomla are among the items being eyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bigger projects are the Canada Post Shipping plugin (using the new CP API), QuickBooks Pro integration, a gift card feature, and an order entry via the admin. I have primary sponsors for &nbsp;all but one of these features already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we can build smaller individual components instead of grafting everything to a huge-and-getting-huger admin, the opportunity exists to get compartimentalized features out the door sooner than later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smoothing out the very rough edges &nbsp;is the immediate priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to interject here that I was asked, &quot;What about Joomla 3?&quot;. I want to talk about this in future podcasts; for now, the idea is to embark on a continuous refactoring of the base code, using the new library, and the Framework-on-Framework, to help us manage the transition so we have no disruptions. But, first things first, we need to smooth out the rough edges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quick Hits:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few quick highlights...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I now have the Akeeba Framework-on-Framework installable zips on LaSalleMart.com. When FoF is updated, I run a couple of builds locally and the new zip file is available to the world with no further ado. This work is a prelude for including FoF into my Joomla distro, as well as a hat-tip thank you to Nicholas at Akeeba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ProjectFork, a project management extension for Joomla,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://projectfork.net/blog/projectfork-team/one-final-change-before-the-beta.php\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"One final change before the beta\">has an interesting blog post</a>&nbsp;about their new version. Version 4 will have a library -- akin to LaSalleMart and a bit of an ode to FoF, which is an integral aspect of the popular Akeeba suite of Joomla extensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly formed executive of the Joomla User Group Toronto, of which I am a part, meets weekly via Google+ Hangouts. I confess a curiosity about the live broadcasting via YouTube, given my over 70 podcasts and handful of videos since 2010. There is a way to shift video from the cam to the screen, to do screen sharing. If this records via YouTube, then this could be a way to get quick how-to&#39;s into LaSalleMart itself, not to mention doing intimate little conference calls with my Club Commerce members. Something I&#39;m keeping in mind...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(10, 14, 3, 'Lasallemart12', '<p>Welcome to my December 2012 &nbsp;&ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast. Hello, my name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Tuesday, December 11th, 2012. &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; is my monthly update about LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and my new LaSalleCMS, published at the top of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce extension for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my limited membership site for my consulting peers, and for technically oriented site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my new Joomla Distro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A month ago, I completed my LaSalleMart 2.0 launch. Having done so, I took a deep relaxing breath and looked at my handiwork. It didn&#39;t take long to conclude that I had more work to do. Most glaring was the lack of a LaSalleMart website. Wanting to direct everyone to my SouthLaSalleCommerce site, all that I accomplished was to confuse myself. My sites were not intuitive to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had five sites last month. Now, it&#39;s pared down to three sites:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>LaSalleMart.com = &nbsp;extension&#39;s site;</li>\r\n	<li>SouthLaSalleCommerce = premium subscription site for consultants and technically oriented site owners;</li>\r\n	<li>LaSalleCMS = my new Joomla distro.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Unchanged are my blog and media sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month I launched one subscription offering. Now there are three subscription offerings. Unchanged is my SouthLaSalleCommerce site. This is my limited membership site aimed at consultants and site owners, where subscriptions are $36CDN/month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New is my LaSalleMart subscription for access to all LaSalleMart downloads and to my Ticket System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subscription is $5.65CDN/month, a price that encourages active users to support LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subscription revenue fixes bugs and ongoing refactoring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d rather spend time refactoring the codebase, rather than just fixing bugs, b/c there&#39;s a bigger payoff broadening out the new LaSalleMart library &amp; busting up the admin into smaller components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, I resisted offering a conventional extension site with a conventional subscription with a conventional ticket system. Having stared at my unconventional launch a month ago, I then understood that what I really needed to do was offer both approaches: the traditional extension offering; and, my unconventional Club Commerce offering. Which led to the creation of my new LaSalleMart website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After mulling over my launch a month ago, I decided to initiate a brand new project, with a new domain, called LaSalleCMS.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was going to be a purely in-house project is now, instead, a public project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my new Joomla Distro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart feels like the add-on that it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LaSalleMart admin requires too many clicks to access and navigate. It is one huge component and unwieldly for developing new features. More menu items are required, and not buried in a sub-menu somewhere.&nbsp;The registration and address management needs to be seamless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of LaSalleCMS is to provide the Joomla-side integrations necessary to deliver a unified Joomla-LaSalleMart ecommerce experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The now defunct Square One Joomla distro project accomplished important work. It set a critical precedent that there can be, and should be, Joomla distros. Although I am not using the Square One distro as my starting point for LaSalleCMS, there&#39;s no reason why we cannot build up a Joomla distro as we see fit to shape it. I see LaSalleCMS as a community project for the community&#39;s benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we did witness the demise of the Square One project. And it is this demise that makes me brave enough to set up a &quot;Supporter&#39;s Subscription&quot; for LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This monthly subscription is $5.65CDN/month. It&#39;s purpose is to pay for programming. One hundred supporters pays for $6,000 of dev per year, which I guess-timate is enough to generate a critical mass of programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I set up a new Google Group and GitHub account for LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, LaSalleCMS is exactly Joomla 2.5.8. Frankly, my distro is not worth downloading right now. Why is this? Well, it was enough to set up the repo, the new website, Akeeba Release System, and the Phing builds. The basics work. For the time being, LaSalleCMS development is powered by the needs of LaSalleMart, which is enough to kick-start some action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is a fork of the alpha release of Tienda for Joomla 2.5. This version of Tienda was not a straight conversion of its Joomla 1.5 releases. Most notable was the creation of a new library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I busted up Tienda into all its individual pieces. Along with the component, there is the library; and, about 60 plugins and 40 modules. Each piece needs to be installed separately via the Joomla installer -- only a small handful of pieces are required for installation.&nbsp;Each piece will eventually have a Joomla updater or Akeeba Live Update hook to it -- right now, only the components have Akeeba Live Update installed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason to bust it up is to create lego blocks of code that are put together during the build phase of software development. In this way, a matrix of LaSalleMart builds will become a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already, there is a payoff: there are six LaSalleMart component packages. Canada, California, Florida, North Carolina; and, free and paid Standard packages. The first four mentioned have taxes built in for these specific jurisdictions. All these packages are created without duplicating source code. Software build processes grabs code from multiple source code repositories to create the packages you can download. Akeeba Live Update is installed in the components, which means that I can get bug fixes and upgrades to you minutes after committing the code. None of this waiting around stuff for releases for critical bug fixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the next few weeks user testing of the base LaSalleMart will take place. I already have arrangements in place for other sets of eyes to do some UAT. As well, I have a nice list compiled during my launches to clean some things up. Included in my list is working on LaSalleCMS, and creating my first Joomla-LaSalleMart distro. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of infrastructure required to maintain such a distro, but the predicates are in place which is what I wanted to accomplish at this point. What this distro means is that you just install Joomla as an encompassing &quot;install-once&quot; package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With your brick and mortar business you are from Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With your online business you are from Venus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are awesome with the business you grew from nothing. But growing an online business is not something you trained for, not something &nbsp;you necessarily want to do. But you feel compelled to do ecommerce. Where you feel control with your business, it feels like there&#39;s no control over your online business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the subtext of many -- and I mean many -- conversations I&#39;ve had over the years. Control freaks who know their business cold feel helpless with their online business. And you know what invariably happens? Business owners turn into consumers with their online business, because consumerism seems like the last bastion of control. No way people would look at their core business like they do with their online business, absolutely no way. Most business owners don&#39;t even talk the lexicon of business when they talk to me about their online business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With your core business, you know you are building an asset. You know you are building value and growing revenues. Well, it should be the same with your online business: you are building an asset that will grow in value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, for a lot of people, buying a subscription on one of the software-as-a-service cloud outfits is the way to go. Revenues are modest, and the only way to generate those revenues economically is to go all-in using someone else&#39;s ecommerce technology. But, for a lot of people, there are six and seven figure revenues to generate, and to generate it they find that they are paying and paying and paying for these supposedly cheap software-as-a-service sites. Or, they are fiddling with the free open source carts and discovering that the software is free but that&#39;s about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, in a fit of irritation, as is wont to happen, you discover that what you are really doing is supporting other peoples&#39; lines of business. I wrote a blog post&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2012/keep-your-value-in-the-family\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Club Commerce-LaSalleMart vs Magento-Ebay: Keep Your Value in The Family\">about becoming ensnared in &quot;ecosystems&quot;</a>, alerting you that your participation in other peoples&#39; ecommerce ecosystems represents a lot of value to them. That this particpation represents a transfer of value from you to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&#39;t get into the mechanic business to pay less money to fix your car. It really does sound absurd that getting into the technology business results in cheaper technology and greater value encapsulation. But, it does!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Technology Business is the business you are in when you have an online business.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter what your core business, there&#39;s money to be made being in the Technology Business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The money is in the ability to create code. Not in the code itself -- which I know sounds weird. The money -- big money -- resides in the ability to produce code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You do not want to consume other peoples&#39; software, you want to produce your own software. My business is enabling you to be in the Technology Business. LaSalleMart exists because my clients need their own ecommerce technology, and despite a long hard search finding one it came down to having a technology for ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing clients together in my Club Commerce is how clients whose core business is not technology get into the technology business with the least cost and least pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It sure seems like the right thing to do is to use these ecommerce sites with the templates and everything. Forget about building sites yourself, just whip up a template, add a few products, and away you go. It&#39;s all there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, you pay. These sites exist to make money for the owners of those sites, y&#39;know. Some take a piece of each sale, on top of the payment gateway vigourish you pay per sale. You pay for the extra accroutements in a &quot;you want fries with that&quot; mode. If you do not want your site to look generically like other sites, you have to customize your layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The raw cost basis of software development is borsht</strong>. You take an older computer you have lying around and install the free Linux on it. Then, you install the free database, programming language, and web server &quot;stack&quot; on it. Then you install a bunch of programming tools on it that are available for free to everyone on this planet. Then, you install a programming editor for free (I got my wonderful one on sale for $50). Then you sign up for the absolutely free code-in-the-cloud repository site (some charge a nominal amount). Are you tallying up the costs so far? The raw cost of setting up a programming computer is basically zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just remember that when you sign up for these ecommerce SaaS sites -- what do you think they are using to build and run their sites? Exactly the same thing that everyone else is using, and the very same things that are available to everyone on planet Earth for borsht. How do you think people seed a zillion start-ups?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It used to be that this was about it. But the game is changing, and for the better for you. There is a hot and juicy code creation technology brewing, and because it is not fully matured there is extra value in it for those that dive into it now. I&#39;ve pointed this out to you on my blog, and the only thing that&#39;s changed is that this stuff is hotter now than it was when I first reported it to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not give a hoot about the ins-and-outs of technology, but you do give a hoot about making money. And by getting into the code creation business you open yourself to business opportunities that will never, ever be open to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the money you will spend latching onto someone else&#39;s ecosystem, you could be banding together with your business peers to amortize technology costs together, being all-in in &nbsp;the technology business, and building tremendous value and profits in so doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know that LaSalleMart 2.0 is raw. My re-launch has delayed initial user testing by a month -- it was a worthwhile cause! Well, now it&#39;s time for me to smooth out some rough edges. I have a list to go through, and a small but growing number of consultants and end-users will provide feedback as well. In about three weeks, LaSalleMart 2.0 will be at a fabulous point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to mention the Akeeba Framework on Framework. This is a framework for Joomla developed by a top Joomla extension developer. It is going to bring a lot of value to your websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new version is being built and it is shaping up to be an absolute gem. It accommodates Joomla 3, so by using this framework today our handiwork designed for Joomla 2.5 today will continue to work in Joomla 3 tomorrow. It will speed up Joomla extension development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can hardly keep up with all the commit comments, but I can&#39;t wait to dive in. It looks like there is form handling which is fabulous. Stunning, really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you are looking at is a lower cost of development. The code itself will be faster and cheaper to create. What is of paramount importance is developing the code within a proper infrastructure, to get the optimum value out of the powerful infrastructure tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what&#39;s the plan after smoothing out LaSalleMart&#39;s roughest edges in the upcoming weeks? There are feature sponsors emerging. There may be a period of infrastructure building and refactoring LaSalleMart to support these features. In English, before diving into creating new features, LaSalleMart might be rejigged to better accomodate these new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, there might be an initial period devoted to setting up the software development infrastructure to support an explosion of code creation. I will communicate what is happening with new features through my blog and through my monthly &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcasts, so you will always know what is happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will LaSalleMart 2.0 be on the JED? Yes. Perhaps in January after we smooth things out -- we&#39;ll see how the timing goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is profiled at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://admincredible.com/blog/item/27-lasallemart\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bob Bloom and LaSalleMart 2.0\">http://admincredible.com/blog/item/27-lasallemart</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(11, 15, 3, 'Lasallemart13', '<p>Happy New Year!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to my January 2013 &nbsp;&ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Monday January 07th, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast comes to you at the top of the month to update you about LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce extension for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my limited membership site for my consulting peers, and for technically oriented site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my new Joomla Distro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[My podcast has more info as I strayed from my script this month -Bob]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is at a delicious point now. The forking exercise is done. The builds are done. The websites are done. Over the holidays I finished the first round of user testing myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I have sites on deck for clients I&#39;ve had for years, who are on board with LaSalleMart, who are going to go through LaSalleMart critically but lovingly. I&#39;ve had pretty frank discussions about this testing already, and I expect this aspect of user testing to go well. By the end of January we&#39;ll have kicked the shit out of LaSalleMart quite a bit, have worked out whatever kinks I&#39;ve been told to smooth out, and LaSalleMart will be ready for listing on the Joomla Extension Directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I forked Tienda all over again from scratch -- its very first Joomla 2.5 incarnation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 1.0 achieved that point where it went through a pretty thorough user testing. I ended up cleaning up the checkout PHP files, cleaning up registration form layouts, and generally cleaning things up. Then, that was the end of life for LaSalleMart 1.0 as no one wanted a Joomla 1.5 cart anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 1.0 achieved that point where it was ready to really take off. Well, LaSalleMart 2.0 is nearly there. It is certainly at the point where it&#39;s kick-the-tires-able.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For LaSalleMart 2.0, I lavished time on the behind-the-scenes builds. I set the table to produce a matrix of LaSalleMart packages, starting with 6 simultaneous packages right now. This is only the appetizer of what will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My behind-the-scenes code creation efforts will remain significant throughout LaSalleMart&#39;s development because there&#39;s a huge payoff to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In part, my efforts are a result of my extreme pissed-off-ed-ness of waiting and waiting and waiting evermore for ecomm projects to release updates. Well, once a LaSalleMart bug fix is &quot;in the can&quot;, I can get the update to you in 10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My entire attitude about release cycles and the &quot;software development life cycle&quot; has changed in the last six-odd months. Testing new-fangled ideas with LaSalleMart 1.0, and studying the emergence of &quot;continuous&quot; methodologies -- which I&#39;ve expounded in earlier podcasts and blog posts -- convinced me of the feasibility of producing code faster, &nbsp;and delivering it to you super duper fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More code, better code, faster turnaround, lower cost, and relevant features that make you more money. It&#39;s not a pipe dream. But it sure is a different beast than what&#39;s been purveyed. It&#39;s blazing a trail, not merely doing what the other guys are doing. It&#39;s looking ahead and leading, and not worrying about the rear mirror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much has been happening with LaSalleCMS, and not much will happen this month either. Still, I am glad that I set it up -- have an initial repository and build for it. NowI have the basis to do work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of accepting Joomla as-is, I created LaSalleCMS to have a chance to do whatever needs to be done to Joomla before it hits real websites. It&#39;s not about altering Joomla into some other form, or marching Joomla down a different road. I&#39;m talking about being able to shed stuff we never touch, like the banner. I&#39;m talking about packaging up Joomla with my favourite extensions as part of the base install. I&#39;m talking about building LaSalleMart along side a custom Joomla version so we can integrate LaSalleMart and Joomla into one seamless experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon there will be a Magento style package where it&#39;s basically just a &quot;Joomla ecommerce&quot; package -- bada-bing!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of technicals to get through before these packages are rolling. I still have to nail using the Akeeba Release System in conjunction with the Joomla Updater for modules, plugins and libraries. There are challenges integrating extensions at the build point. I&#39;ve started working on these challenges, but nothing quite ready-to-go yet. But it is happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I view LaSalleCMS as an important aspect of LaSalleMart. I think it&#39;s crazy to passively accept key software as-is. The GPL licence says it&#39;s kosher to tweak Joomla, so I&#39;m going to tweak Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For one thing, Joomla has already demonstrated that new versions of itself will obsolete into oblivion extensions built for previous versions. This change has to be managed, and the only way to manage it is to do a distro. We&#39;ll I have a distro and I&#39;m going to manage change so LaSalleMart 2.0 does not become obsolete overnight like LaSalleMart 1.0 did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to bust up Joomla similar to what the now defunct Square One Distro did. Get Joomla leaner by discarding pieces that we rarely use. Then, in the event that we need these pieces, make &#39;em installable just like any other Joomla component would be installable. Use the Akeeba Release System as the upgrade server, and off we go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I bust up Joomla, I want to come up with a way to integrate extensions at the build stage. The end result will be a matrix of &quot;quicklaunch&quot; style Joomla install packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Integrating extensions involves a simulated installation at the build stage. Should extensions be in their own software repositories, or should they be integrated from their own packaged state -- I&#39;m not sure yet. I want to dig into this aspect of LaSalleCMS first, because how we deal with this integration will determine how exactly to bust up Joomla; how to treat third party extensions for integration; and, how to structure in-house development for integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is not the corn flakes of Joomla ecommerce. It&#39;s not going to be on every shelf in every home. It&#39;s not going to have the most downloads or the biggest user base. It&#39;s not me over here producing it and you over there consuming it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is me and my extended family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>300 extended family in Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe 200-300 subscribing to the $5.65 LaSalleMart subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps 100 subscribing to the $5.65 LaSalleCMS &quot;Supportor&quot; subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m not talking thousands or tens of thousands. All told, 600 subscribers world-wide. A drop in the bucket for some projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially for Club Commerce, where my members get to know each other, it&#39;s an extended family providing peer support, cost sharing, and project support. It&#39;s an extended family blazing a trail, leading with technology and realizing superior returns for doing so. It&#39;s about active involvement. It&#39;s about amortizing the costs of technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not churning out the corn flakes of ecommerce for a mass market to consume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am creating a way for business people to own their technological piece of the rock, who would otherwise be shit-out-of-luck doing it on their own. Who have an enduring, accessible technology to call their own with long-term support. &nbsp;And earning a kick-ass money in so doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those in the Toronto area, this Wednesday is a Joomla Group Toronto &quot;Ask the Expert&quot; panel on the Danforth -- I&#39;m one of the experts. &nbsp;If you can&#39;t make it but have a burning question, pose it on the Group&#39;s Facebook page -- click the JUGT logo on the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will update what is happening during the month on my blog. For now, I want to put down my mic and get back to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(12, 16, 3, 'Lasallemart14', '<p>Welcome to my February 2013 &nbsp;&ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Monday February 18th, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast comes to you at the top of the month to update you about LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce extension for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my limited membership site for my consulting peers, and for technically oriented site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my new Joomla Distro. A shout-out to Atlassian.com for granting my LaSalleCMS an open source licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made the mistake of delaying this monthly podcast in anticipation of announcing LaSalleMart 2.0&#39;s application to the Joomla Extension Directory. However, in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, the act of anticipation seemed to delay it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever the state of LaSalleMart, I will podcast at the top of the month from here on in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, my &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcasts are addressed to a wide audience. But, this time, I want to speak specifically to my incredible circle of supporters. Usually I would send a MailChimp missive to them, but this time, I want to talk to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your demand for LaSalleMart 2.0 is getting ahead of my user testing debugging and checkout improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you know, LaSalleMart 2.0 is a fork of the very first, and so far, only Tienda version for Joomla 2.5. This version is an &quot;alpha&quot; version, meaning that the authors know it is not ready for real sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of my efforts are concentrated on getting core functionality ready for real sites. For your sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, checkout was in need of not just debugging, but of feature upgrades. Simply put, there was no way I am going to release LaSalleMart 2.0 with the checkout we inherited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modal forms for inputting addresses pisses me off. Not that they worked, but the flow irritates me. I could redesign the forms that display in the modal -- that is, the pop-up -- box, but what difference would that make? It still stinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two separate areas of LaSalleMart, and one area of Joomla, that interact during checkout: there&#39;s the checkout, the addresses, and Joomla&#39;s site registration. What I want LaSalleMart 2.0&#39;s checkout to do is to flow between these areas seamlessly, to give your customers a smooth flowing, intuitive checkout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much has been made about one-page checkout and guest checkout. One page checkout does not work, so I made it unavailable. Guest checkout -- screw it, I&#39;ll worry about it later. I read a study that online customers hate registering because they don&#39;t trust the websites to leave them alone. They think guest checkout prevents the seller from obtaining information with which to harass &#39;em with endless emails. Technically, I want the base checkout to work before worrying about the permutations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If site registration is initiated from LaSalleMart&#39;s checkout, then your buyers are redirected to Joomla&#39;s native site registration form. What we inherited was the cart taking over site registration, which was clumsy. The complaint is that there are too many registration steps involved and that your customers are going to abandon checkout in the early steps. No worries, they&#39;ll crap out of your site because of the crappy forms they can&#39;t follow, and that don&#39;t work because the javascript is choking on who-knows-what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are in the cart and you do not have a login, then you are whisked to a clean site registration form. When you are done, you get an email and then you log in. No, you don&#39;t need an email, so you just login -- because you set notification emails to &quot;no&quot; in Global Configuration. Well, what I did was add code to an existing mandatory plugin that you&#39;ll have installed anyways that automatically logs in your buyer. They see nothing extra, they do nothing extra. They are just logged in, and then whisked to the address form. We inherited a page that announced the link to the dreaded modal form, and also had an address form right there because, there&#39;s no address in the database! I found this confusing -- yes, even me. Do I click the link to get the address form, or fill out the address form and ignore the link to the address form. Y&#39;know, give me a freakin&#39; break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were rolling right along with user testing. We found a bunch of stuff, which is the point of user testing. But, geez, this is not fixing checkout. This is building new features. And that is exactly what I did. Checkout is a new feature, not a mere tweak. I chopped up a big php checkout file into smaller, more intuitive pieces, so that my code matches the checkout steps. Easier to follow now, and a better base with which to modify later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have achieved the checkout flow between registration, addresses, and the checkout that I am looking for. However, there is a bug with the non-default shipping address that is defying my debugging efforts. Getting close. There is a database error to fix at the order creation point after this. Then, the checkout flow needs refinement. If I was merely tweaking, then no way I&#39;d be worrying about shipping address id and database INSERTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a modest to-do list after checkout is taken care of. These things are a must, ahead of my imminent application to the Joomla Extension Directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Included in this list is having all individual modules and plugins, and the LaSalleMart library (lib_lmf) updatable via the Joomla installer, with the Akeeba Release System as the update server. There are about 60 individual ones to set up, once I resolve the set-up issues. After much effort figuring out these remaining issues, I&#39;m about to submit an Akeeba Release System support request. Otherwise, how to get upgrades to you? I do not, by design, upgrade individual modules and plugins via the component&#39;s installation/upgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once all this is done, I do want to test coupons, ahead of the anticipated requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the JED application is submitted, there are two projects that I should be able to do rather speedily -- I shouldn&#39;t jinx myself. The Canada Post shipping plugin, and modifying the Gavick News Info module for LaSalleMart -- for a real site. I will submit my modifications to Gavick, and maybe we&#39;ll see our first template club customization for LaSalleMart in conjunction with my JED application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a couple of sites that require a pre-JED version of LaSalleMart installed, and for these sites I will do this install. For other sites, and for the public, a couple of more weeks ought to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://projectfork.net/blog/13-releases/44-designs-component-released\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProjectFork blog - Designs Component Released\">latest ProjectFork blog post</a>&nbsp;has a very good paragraph:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Forgive us for our excitement but this has been a long time coming. It was a tough decision to rebuild Projectfork knowing that we&#39;d have to stop all commercial development until Projectfork 4 Community was stable. That&#39;s over 2 years of upfront work just to get back our free version, essentially square one.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Amen to you! Similarly, it&#39;s over two years being on my LaSalleMart journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, I had a terrific fork of the original software the first time around, and then Joomla 1.5 went poof, necessitating a complete re-fork. Oh yes, not going to re-fork again for the next Joomla version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots of upfront work -- I hear you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My next &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast ought to be exciting!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

And of course prepping this podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the initial launch on New Years when I released LaSalleMart 2 for user testing. That initial user testing went well, as problems were discovered. The order details form in admin was broken, checkout was &nbsp;not ready and had to be revamped, the default date format was messed up, and there were a bunch of little things that were cleaned up. PayPal Standard was tested and passed -- to my relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tested my integrated Joomla-LaSalleMart packages during this initial user testing, and uncovered a few technical issues that need more work -- so these &quot;distro&quot; packages will not be released right now. In fact, I&#39;m wondering if I should re-think how I construct these packages because Joomla itself looks to be moving towards package management in version 3.x. &nbsp;I&#39;ll save this discussion for another time. Suffice to say that my &quot;distros&quot; are hardly forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The updates initiated within the Joomla Administrator work -- whew! What seems like an easy thing to accomplish was a bit of a journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All my modules, plugins, components, and the library are tethered to the same version number. At some point, I will decouple the common versioning so that each installable piece has its own version number. I need to let the version tethering linger a bit longer, so in the very short term, each update will trigger renewed updates in the Joomla Updater for all your LaSalleMart modules, plugins, and the library, although most of these do not actually have updated code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treating updates as major releases with launches will now simmer down into a boring stream of quiet updates. Work on LaSalleMart is ongoing, and updates will be delivered to you, by design, immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expect updates every week. Sometimes every day. Yes, that often. By design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are seven client development sites with LaSalleMart 2.0 installed. Each in various states of development, and most slated to go live (as a couple are proof-of-concept). One site is supposed to go live in a couple of weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is not just sitting in the lab. It&#39;s Out There For Real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was introduced to Tienda in 2009 through the Joomla User Group Toronto. If my memory serves, a couple of JUGT members came back from a JoomlaDay NYC with stories about a new Joomla cart built from the ground up in Joomla 1.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incredibly, it&#39;s been three years already, when, in April 2010, we were treated to a seminar here in Toronto by Tienda&#39;s Founder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of Joomla User Group Toronto, my JUGT article was published in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.southlasallemedia.com/wp-admin/Joomla%20User%20Group%20Toronto%20--%20The%20Journey\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://magazine.joomla.org/issues/issue-mar-2013/item/1116-joomla-user-groiup-toronto-the-journey\">March 2013 Joomla Community Magazine</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A certain other cart extension I specialized in (that&#39;s starts with a &quot;V&quot; and ends with my own &quot;Mart&quot;) was slow in switching to Joomla 1.5. I was shopping around for a new ecomm technology with which to base my consulting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh boy, I had no idea the journey I was starting!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward to the fall of 2012.&nbsp;Who knew that I would fork Tienda, not once, but twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 1.0 was my fork of Tienda for Joomla 1.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 is my fork of Tienda version 0.10 for Joomla 2.5. The actual filename that I forked is &quot;tienda_v0-10-0-alpha.zip&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Joomla 3.5 is released, LaSalleMart will not have to be conjured up from scratch again. How LaSalleMart will be conjured up for the next Joomla is a topic I am leaving for another time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were not kidding about this file being &quot;alpha&quot;. They are not kidding about the warning that displays above the download link that says, &quot;This version is presently an alpha version, not designed for production use&quot;. No kidding, it crapped out on my development site, dissipating all my fantasies of it working on a live site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value of this file is immense because it saved me from having to convert Tienda to Joomla 2.5 myself. However, getting it operational was a major effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was not a straight conversion of Tienda. They did not take the Tienda they had and only change what needed to be changed. They built a new library, and did other things. This is not a criticism, because converting from Joomla 1.5 to 2.5 involves more than just doing a bunch of search and replaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The file that I forked represented a snapshot in time more than anything else, as the code was very much a work-in-progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent to forking this file, I discovered an active Tienda repository on GitHub.com. Studying the code and code comments, and the issue tracker, provided further insights into Tienda development. However, the code is a work-in-progress. There were very specific instances where I pasted code to LaSalleMart from it, but no way I was going to do a from-scratch fork do-over based on the entire GitHub repo. The cost-benefit just did not justify it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between October 2012 and today -- the day I apply to the JED -- there were no further Tienda releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I find it rather shocking, but it&#39;s a fact: I have an operational version of Tienda for Joomla 2.5 first.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My version is not perfect, as I enumerate on my website. But, it is operational, and it is continuously improving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did have fanciful notions at the start. I wanted to build out features. I wanted to clean up the code. I wanted to amputate some features. I wanted to pretty-fy the layouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the reality changed these notions in a hurry to: (a) get it operational on Joomla 2.5; and, (b) create a new code delivery mechanism, because post-launch there will be a continuous stream of updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Success!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now those fanciful notions are starting to dance in my head again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Operational means &nbsp;you can enter products and categories, set up standard shipping rates, and pay through offline payments and with PayPal Standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Operational means an improved checkout to achieve smooth integration between site registration, address management, and checkout. This had to be done simply because I did not like checkout as it was, including no more modal forms in checkout which is good for mobile devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check my blog for in-month updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(14, 18, 3, 'Lasallemart16', '<p>Welcome to my April 2013 &nbsp;&ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Wednesday, April 03rd, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast comes to you at the top of the month to update you about LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce extension for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my limited membership site for my consulting peers, and for technically oriented site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my new Joomla Distro. A shout-out to Atlassian.com for granting my LaSalleCMS an open source licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JED:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first week of March, I applied for LaSalleMart to be listed on the Joomla Extensions Directory. I&#39;ve not heard anything, and my application is still pending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JED is volunteer run, so it takes as long as it takes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INITIAL SITES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month there were 7 LaSalleMarts in development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One nascent project was not pursued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A client with two sites is busy and not in a rush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One site is about to go live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three sites are abandoned. One went live, but was then converted to BigCommerce. The reason why the site was converted was never actually explained to me, but I&#39;m sure I figured it out for myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite my podcasts, blog, and specific and up-to-date articles on LaSalleMart.com, plus a MailChimp email list, plus usual client communications, it seems that nature of LaSalleMart was not quite understood. Coupons not working seemed to be &quot;the last straw&quot;, and my client fell off the face of the earth, never to be heard from again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that I&#39;m taking from this is doing free work on sites because a client is the first to go live or the first to do user testing or whatever. There are only a very very few people I&#39;m going to do this for from now on. Chances are pretty good that if we&#39;re not already in an arrangement, then there&#39;s going to be money involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feature sponsorship was discussed, but in retrospect follow through never happened. I look back and I think what was supposed to &quot;really&quot; happen was that I provide the technology for free, and then bill on the actual direct consulting I do with that technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to remind everyone out there that I am not a &quot;Solutions Provider&quot;. I don&#39;t survey the ecommerce world, analyze your situation, and then provide the best fit ecommerce solution. I had quite the discussion in 2010 about this, I won&#39;t forget it, after the Toronto Joomla seminar on Tienda, where I was counselled after it finished on becoming a solutions provider. I replied that I wanted to specialize in an ecomm technology, and knowing a bit about everything but good in nothing was not my goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, don&#39;t have in the back of your mind that I&#39;m going to suggest to you something other than what I specialize in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyways, I&#39;ll have more on LaSalleMart&#39;s development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APP-I-FYING LASALLEMART:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the first live site went un-live, I went through it on all the Apple devices, and LaSalleMart looked good, especially the checkout. At the end of March Break, we went to the Yorkdale Apple store, and I played with LaSalleMart quite a bit. Checkout was visually very clean in checkout. Having worked my ass off on checkout, it is gratifying to see how clean and smooth it was in the outside world. I consider what I did as &quot;app-i-fying&quot; LaSalleMart, so that checkout looks &quot;app-ish&quot;, and on my first live site it&#39;s mission accomplished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is another site about to go live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably this week. It&#39;s a California site, and I needed to finish some hammering and nailing on the tax handling. The product attributes and standard shipping also underwent some work too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WEBSITE CHANGES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few changes to my websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My LaSalleCMS subscription and ticket system are deleted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Anahita site at SouthLaSalleCommerce.com is gone. In its place I have subscribed to Atlassian&#39;s Confluence, which is more suited specifically to software development. Confluence ties into JIRA, the deeply featured issue tracker, which ties into Bitbucket software repositories. It literally breaks my heart to not use Anahita, which is coming out with version 3. But my needs are uber-specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I deleted my $5 LaSalleMart subscription. There is only the $36 subscription. The ticket system is still there, but will likely disappear in lieu of using Confluence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am now down to a mere 4 websites: LaSalleMart, LaSalleCMS, ecomm blog, and this Media site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am now taking on two Atlassian websites: the LaSalleMart Confluence website; and, the LaSalleCMS Confluence website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am committed to Atlassian as a long term goal. The only way to learn it is to use it, so Confluence and JIRA (and BitBucket) are becoming part of my daily work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, I added something new to my LM admin: a form to submit issues directly to my JIRA issue tracker. No more email: you see something I need to know about in LM2? Then fire off the form right there in admin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LM2 STALLING, RE-IGNITING:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2.0 was humming along at its JED launch. Then, it seemed to stall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as waiting for the JED listing&#39;s been a momentum letdown, so has been the lack of the critical mass of feature sponsors has not materialized. There&#39;s been a lot of talk, but little action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hounding me to produce a feature by giving up sleep in the wee hours is not what I mean by &quot;Feature Sponsorship&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telling me that a critical new feature will help future sales in order to spur me to give up sleep in the wee hours is not what I mean by &quot;Feature Sponsorship&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feature sponsorship is you paying for all, or part, of a feature -- and then usually defining specs and participating in &nbsp;issue resolution and testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Development is not going to be an uninterrupted ascension. This month I tweaked my websites yet again, as their final form is settling down now. My use of Confluence and JIRA is accelerating. Took time to work out the rough edges ahead of two live sites. We forged ahead, we progressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, now it&#39;s time to re-ignite feature sponsorship and live deployment. I will have more details after I publish this podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RECENT JOOMLA 1.5 HACKS HAVE MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON ME:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spate of recent Joomla 1.5 hacks have made a deep impression on me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J!1.5 is officially not supported by the Joomla project. But we still have a lot of J!1.5 sites out there. Hackers are targeting the soft spots in these sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could go back in time, I&#39;d get extreme with J!1.5 initial installations. &nbsp;I would literally manage Joomla directly. The prevailing wisdom is to not touch Joomla, you just don&#39;t touch the core. However, one day Joomla 2.5 will be end-of-life just like Joomla 1.5, and we&#39;ll be managing site whose code we should have taken charge right from the outset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should have chopped off a ton of code from Joomla 1.5. Well, I want to chop off a ton of code from Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing it right is going to take a lot of work. It&#39;s not just amputating code, it&#39;s about creating real installable packages for the amputated code. We want to be able to pick-and-choose what we want, and don&#39;t want, in our base Joomla installations. We need to get extreme in what we amputate and package up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s been a number of attempts to create such a Joomla Distribution. However, it takes a lot of work, and money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Joomla Distro is LaSalleCMS. I will have more info about how I want to proceed after this podcast is published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(15, 19, 3, 'Lasallemart17', '<p>Welcome to my May 2013 &nbsp;&ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Thursday, May 02nd, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast comes to you at the top of the month to update you about LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce extension for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my limited membership site for my consulting peers, and for technically oriented site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my Joomla Distro.

LaSalleMart development is just too intense right now. In April the new Knowledge Base sprouted, there were six builds, several core areas received a makeover, and I&#39;m up to 41 issues in my issue tracker already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LaSalleCMS distro is close to my heart, if not so close to my keyboard right now. The power represented by taking Joomla by the balls is immense. It is idiotic accepting Joomla like passive receivers -- it is extremely bad business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/take-it-from-the-man-make-joomla-your-joomla\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Take It From The Man: Make Joomla Your Joomla\">The Man of the Joomla platform project said</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>...you bust things up so people can roll their own distro that better suits their needs.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla itself is comprised of a bunch of different things. There&#39;s the Joomla platform and the Joomla library. There are little FOSS programs inside Joomla that Joomla uses. There are a bunch of extensions that are built into Joomla that many of us don&#39;t even use. There are templates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I think of WordPress -- this site is WordPress -- I think of one unified whole that is untouchable. Whether this is really accurate or not does not matter as I don&#39;t think of WordPress in the same way that I think of Joomla. I don&#39;t use WP like I do Joomla. Joomla is different, is build differently, and my perception of using WordPress is far narrower than my expansive outlook on Joomla usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla itself needs to be taken firmly in hand. To be frank about this, I want subscription revenue to grow so that I can peel off a layer of this cash to devote to LaSalleCMS. LaSalleCMS is all set up, it has an Atlassian open source licence, everything we do will be open to the world for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I&#39;ve pointed out before many times, there is no shortage of efforts to &quot;distro-ize&quot; Joomla. The common problem is sustainability. The effort has always proved more intense than anticipated, the issues much more technically challenging than anticipated. Efforts come to a halt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I want to achieve, what I want to do differently than others, is maintain an ongoing commitment to &quot;distro-izing&quot; Joomla. This achievement is powered by money. That money comes from subscription revenue. Ba-da-bing!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I attended the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/atlassian-road-show-2013-in-toronto-first-hand-lessons\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Atlassian Road Show 2013 in Toronto: First Hand Lessons\">Atlassian Road Show</a>&nbsp;at King/Spadina a couple of weeks ago. Great hour long presentation, glad I went. A rare opportunity to learn something first-hand. Following up this week with daily use of JIRA and/or Confluence. My write-up is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/atlassian-road-show-2013-in-toronto-first-hand-lessons\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Atlassian Road Show 2013 in Toronto: First Hand Lessons\">on my blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2 is running successfully on its first live site at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wonderfoodco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart 2 installed at WonderFoodCo.com\">WonderFoodCo.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This site is run by a top-notch consultant in California. Years and years ago, she contacted me about problems with her Virtuemart one point oh sites. We&#39;ve been working together ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suzan&#39;s tried all the carts, followed all the trends, looked at the SaaS sites. She&#39;s followed me with Tienda, and been very encouraging about LaSalleMart. With patience and professionalism, and obviously taking a calculated risk, she offered her site to be the first LaSalleMart 2 site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kudos to Suzan for working with me on product attributes, standard shipping, PayPal Standard, front-end templates, and an assortment of odds-and-ends. We seamlessly shifted from client-consultant to collaborators and back. There were no arguments, no heated exchanges. Treating your live site like one big user testing ground while customers are ordering product takes a certain grace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the heat of all the changes, it was the random ordering of the countries in the address form&#39;s drop-down select box that caused the most irritation. Maybe it was an emotional lighting rod of sorts -- no pun intended. But, yes, of all things, it was frustrating to find your country in that drop-down. That&#39;s what we inherited from the fork. I have bigger LaSalleMart fish to fry, but Suzan was right to get me to focus on this. So I hunted down the code, put USA and Canada at the top, and ordered the countries alphabetically ascending. You know something? The drop-down looks sharp now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, not only did LaSalleMart improve, but I had a renewed focus on human-izing LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of squeezing in incomprehensible help messages in LM2&#39;s admin, I created a brand new text-only Knowledge Base website. Now I link to full explanations in the admin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The category and product admin forms were hard on the eyes. Now, a regular human can read and follow the forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard shipping required a lot of love, because its rules were not fully manifested in the admin forms. What we inherited was not meant to be understood, which is why I could not truly understand the seven types of standard shipping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PayPal Standard worked. But Suzan wanted the ability to specify the messages and PayPal buttons that display in checkout. Done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, LaSalleMart was close already. Wonderfoods put the human touch on LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one area that needs further attention: checkout needs to be streamlined further. Now that we got checkout to where it is, and where it is represents a significant achievement, we (meaning me) have to streamline checkout even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, there are three aspects to checkout that I have to look at:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>streamlining;</li>\r\n	<li>guest checkout;</li>\r\n	<li>multi-step for mobile.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These things are related. This month these three things are at the top of the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/live-lasallemart-site\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WonderFoodCo: Live LaSalleMart Site\">blog post</a>&nbsp;for screen shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This site uses Standard Shipping, PayPal Standard, and product attributes. It&#39;s a straight forward site selling terrific products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site uses the Gavick restaurant template, and LaSalleMart inherits those styles well. We don&#39;t use template over-rides, but you certainly can. I added notes on LM2&#39;s layouts in my new Knowledge Base site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you to Suzan for her commitment to LaSalleMart. The results speak for themselves!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month&#39;s podcast stunk. You know how I know? My wife told me. And she is right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See, whatever it is at the top of the month, you get it. Communication does not suspend due to having a crappy month, and/or my being in a lousy mood. March wasn&#39;t the greatest, but it picked up in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those waiting for LM2&#39;s listing in the Joomla Extension Directory, keep waiting. Status is still &quot;pending&quot;. It&#39;s been two months since applying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you consider a JED listing a type of &quot;seal of approval&quot;, and are holding off with LM2 due to LM2&#39;s non JED listing, then stop waiting and start kicking LM2&#39;s tires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JED is run by volunteers. They will get to LM2 when they get to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart graduated to &quot;Keep Your Eye On These...&quot; status.

Just whip up a quick Joomla site, check it out, and zap it when you&#39;re done. There are no updates, it&#39;s just a demo. Don&#39;t do a real site based on this demo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reading up on the Akeeba Unite app, it might be less painful than I thought to maintain a demo site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a blog post about<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/joomla3-or-no-joomla3\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"To Joomla 3, or Not To Joomla 3?\">&nbsp;LaSalleMart and Joomla 3</a>. Even though LM2 is made for Joomla 2.5, there is no reason why we can&#39;t have the product front-end in a Joomla 3 site, and the checkout and admin in a Joomla 2.5 site. Most templates come in both Joomla flavours now. With both sites sharing the same database, and the J!2.5 site is a subfolder, it&#39;s do-able.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suzan and I are trying out the LaSalleMart Content plugin. This plugin inserts an add-to-cart form in Joomla articles; and, in any extension that renders content plugins. We are trying the plugin out in K2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This add-to-cart plugin works. Which means, you can use the full power of Joomla for your product and category pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that makes me so different than other Joomla consultants and extension developers are my podcasts and blogging. I am steadily approaching 100 podcasts since 2010, and I consistently blog. You can see the progression in real time. My 39th &quot;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs39\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Bob Bloom Show tbbs39:   Why I Came Home To Joomla &amp; Tienda\">The Bob Bloom Show&quot; podcast outlines &quot;Why I Came Home To Joomla &amp; Tienda</a>&quot;. My 44th episode, called &quot;The Birth of LaSalleMart&quot; outlines my Tienda fork, to be called LaSalleMart. You can tell by the dates the tremendous investment in time and effort I&#39;ve devoted to LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can trace LaSalleMart&#39;s genesis and progression very easily in retrospect and in real time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve achieved LaSalleMart&#39;s primary mission:&nbsp;to have in-house Joomla ecommerce technology. As a consultant, I have a unique offering: a real honest-to-goodness Joomla ecomm extension. Not just a private ecomm extension, but one that, I presume, will be listed on the JED.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are sixty-five hundred extensions listed on the JED. The ecomm category lists about three dozen extensions. A mere three dozen! Of these, most are niche extensions or ports/bridges to non Joomla ecomm extensions. Rare is the full featured Joomla ecomm extension. Rarer are those originating from this side of the pond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is finally ready for live sites. One reason it took so long is the investment in the underlying development concepts, things you do not see, was as great, if not perhaps greater, than the investment in creating the code itself. My clients will enjoy a payoff from my foresight and investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are consultants, there are gurus, and then there are those who create technology.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2011/hackerprenomics-the-forbes-article\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hackerprenomics: The Forbes Article\">Forbes Magazine wrote</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The NPV [Net Present Value] on a strong and positive relationship with a talented developer today is ridiculously high.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>With rare in-house Joomla ecommerce technology, I offer my clients the ability to create technology. Creating technology is powerful money maker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A client wants to do something about the fact that most of his buyers use mobile devices, and his site is designed for desktop users. After mulling about a dozen different ideas, and staring at the LaSalleMart codebase from a new angle, I am going to prototype my first LaSalleMart app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have transformed myself from a technology integrator to a technology creator. Back in the day when I put together Virtuemart sites, when a client wanted something I would ask myself where I could grab that feature. Maybe there was a patch or add-on or something. Sitting next to my client complaining about the mobile-centric behaviour of his buyers, I never asked myself where I could grab some add-on even once; but, how best to create a kick-ass solution to leap revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is a conventional ecomm extension, in that one day it will be available on the JED + available for download.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is also the technological base of my consulting engagements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the strangest part of LaSalleMart, but probably LaSalleMart at its most powerful, is the melding of consulting with technology development. With LaSalleMart now ready for real live sites, the time is right to get this strange and wonderful melding off the ground once-and-for-all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest bang-for-the-buck for my clients is: my clients banding together. Which is perhaps the most assinine statement you&#39;ve ever heard. What consultant brings his clients together? Well, formally?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients are, by far, other consultants. Consultants who integrate, counsel, advice, train, maintain, and who are good at graphic design. However, my clients are not programmers. Only a small percentage of my clients are site owners -- who enjoy a &quot;strong and positive relationship with a talented dev&quot;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come closer. I have a word for you. Are you ready? Are you ready to hear this word? &quot;Amortize&quot;. Yup, the word is &quot;amortize&quot;. Meaning, to spread out. Usually thought of as spreading out payments, such as mortgage. Accountants use it to refer to the use of a capital asset over distinct accounting periods. I say &quot;amortize&quot; to mean, for you, the funding of the technology that underlies your revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing my clients together so that they share the costs of their underlying ecomm technology offers the biggest bang for the buck .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you this. Something has changed since I started freelance consulting: everyone has a cart now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your competition has a cart. Consultants galore slap together sites. Everyone is using the open source carts. Everyone is using the SaaS carts. The sites all look the same, feel the same. Everyone is chasing the same mobile solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a technology follower -- worse, being a technology consumer -- is bad business. As a consultant, you just get caught up in technological commodification which inexorably leads to issuing lower invoices to your clients. As a business, return on investment comes from investment in the technology itself. Your ability to lead, your ability to respond properly to your buyers, your ability to set yourself apart, your ability to deliver an exceptional buyer experience, all flows from your technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, boy, the cost of technology is a bitch. I&#39;ll grant you that. But, you know, the barriers are really opportunities. If it were easy, your competitors would be doing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was deep into Virtuemart, in the heyday of Virtuemart, I was creating features. I&#39;d hack coupons for Client A. I&#39;d hack real-world shipping rules for Client B. For Client C, I did sneaky stuff with shopper groups to achieve Costco-ish concepts on a regular ol&#39; Virtuemart site. I did a lot of cool things with Virtuemart!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look back, and I think to myself, boy, if all my clients had these cool things, they could have made a lot more money from their regular ol&#39; Virtuemart sites. In fact, if I had got my clients together, I could have built-out these features more comprehensively, and, incredibly, not have cost my clients any more money than they spent. But, what would have happened is that they would have had more money to spend on me because their sites would have made more money! And with that money, they would have even more money-making features that would have made them even more money!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All my clients would have had to do was agree to share the fruits of their invoice with my other clients. Everyone coughs up some scratch to get the entire technological pie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ll, that&#39;s exactly what I want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I have LaSalleMart at the point where it is ready for real sites, I want to do exactly that. It&#39;s kind of strange, I grant you that. Better I should grow my client base, do individual gigs, and build bespoke features for private clients. But, baby, I&#39;ve been down this road before. What one client wants, my other clients want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not theoretical. Have I phoned up Client A to ask them to give me Bespoke Feature A to Client B, in return for getting Bespoke Feature B? Of course! My clients have done private little sharing deals already, on a small scale, to get sexy features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, Just Amortize Baby!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s put the cart before the horse, and design LaSalleMart&#39;s client-driven development to deliver the biggest bang for the buck for all my clients. Cost share technological development and innovation that powers your revenue. My private client group building sexy kick-ass relevant technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which leads me to something else. LaSalleMart is not designed for the freebie trollers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart will always have that conventional Joomla extension thing about it. It will, presumably, be listed on the JED. There will be a free basic standard download. There will be subscription-only downloads. But not features will be in these LM editions. This is the conventional LM extension available in the conventional way. I am sure the freebie trollers will be frustrated at the lack of features for free -- or for nominal subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, there is the LaSalleMart for those who are on the inside, contributing to its development. This is my private client group, a finite group of clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ve seen what a very few in this group has accomplished. Now, it&#39;s time to broaden my private client group out. Time to broaden development, time to put more money in the pot. Time to amortize!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My $36/month subscription is all about growing my private client group to amortize LaSalleMart&#39;s development. The $36/month pays for Atlassian.com, the cost is not insignicant. It allows me to spend my time on development and less on individual consulting engagements which is the best use of my time. It enables development of the matrix of Joomla Distributions, which is a critical area not satisfied by anyone right now. Inevitably, we will have feature sponsorship, because clients sharing the cost boosts the ROI of that feature right off the bat. Twenty clients kicking in $150 each for Quickbooks integration makes that integration compelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial critical mass of clients is one hundred -- less than that and it&#39;s just too little money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The max is 300. &nbsp;It&#39;s not open ended. I&#39;m not running a retail operation, selling subscriptions as a means to selling software. Each person is my client! I see 300 clients as the upper range of what I can deal with while still maintaining the intimacy and informality I prefer. I don&#39;t start my conversations with my clients, &quot;Hello Mr. Client Number 123, How Are You?&quot;. I get to know my clients, I do have actual phone conversations with my clients. So, there&#39;s an optimal point of amortization vs client base. Which I see as 300 max.&nbsp;The numbers work out well at 300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a very special outcome that my private client group can achieve with LaSalleMart and LaSalleCMS: impute knowledge into the technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are things I&#39;d love to nail, once-and-for-all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like, nailing all the SEO things we can. Not only with LaSalleMart, but with Joomla too. Just have it built in, ready-to-go, into one package. This is a value-added from being in the Distro business. With our Distro, we can add this in. LaSalleCMS may be free to all, but there&#39;s no reason why we can&#39;t add our own little goodies to our private Distros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEO is the type of thing that I&#39;d deal with one-by-one by individual client request. But, what if we just made a separate project of it right off the bat, and chipped away at it. Those learned-from-experience lessons of SEO turned into technological nuggets. Instead of the usual one-off &nbsp;&quot;Bob, can you get this SEO feature into LaSalleMart/Joomla&quot;, let&#39;s systematically capture &#39;em all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing is blogging. Building in blogging capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something I&#39;ve already started is imputing tidbits of knowledge into the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s something that really happened. Suzan told me she does not like the the PayPal image. Can I change it. Seems easy, doesn&#39;t it. But you wouldn&#39;t believe the journey these &quot;easy&quot; questions launch. Where do I get these images? Should I hard-code &#39;em? And the message that goes with these images -- should these be change-able too? So, I created new fields in the plugin&#39;s parameters so you can change the image &amp; message. But, ah.... the image appears in the last two steps of checkout. Before I am asked, because asked I will, I will create user defined fields for each checkout step -- which caused a surprise reverse engineering exercise. The end result: this little journey is now imputed in the code. You get your settings. You get relevant tidbits to speed up your set-up in my new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/lasallemartkb/PayPal+Standard+Payment+Plugin\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart\'s PayPal Standard Plugin Knowledge Base Page\">Knowledge Base</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the Christmas selling season, we could have a comprehensive, and growing, Joomla based ecomm technology that grows your revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(16, 20, 3, 'Lasallemart18', '<p>Welcome to my June 2013 &nbsp;&ldquo;LaSalleMart News&rdquo; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Wednesday, June 05th, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast comes to you at the top of the month to update you about LaSalleMart, Club Commerce, and LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce extension for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Commerce is my limited membership site for my consulting peers, and for technically oriented site owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my Joomla Distro. A shout-out to Atlassian.com for granting my LaSalleCMS an open source licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Live Sites</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three live LaSalleMart sites humming along.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these sites were given sweetheart deals for being the first. But that&#39;s it! LaSalleMart has proved its chops that it can work on a live site. And all the user testing that had to be accomplished with these sites has been accomplished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart has smoothed out a lot of rough edges as a result of these sites, which is exactly what was supposed to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Joomla Extension Directory Listing</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Late May I discovered that my LaSalleMart listing went from &quot;pending&quot; to zapped. I logged in and LaSalleMart was gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the hell is my submission? Well, funny I should ask! At the just concluded Joomla and Beyond 2013 Conference, Matt Baylor hosts a video with this exact title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"169\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UJw6zKPsuV4?rel=0\" width=\"300\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I appreciate that Matt and JAB13 put this on. The plans for the next JED website version sound terrific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, when my submission was zapped, there was no communication. Those who know me have heard me say that &quot;silence is the worst response&quot;. In the new system, there will probably be automatic email notifications to solve this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After my presentation last week, Alan Langford once again gave me incredibly good advice. Good advice is very rare, and my hats off to you Alan for being such a constant source of quality counsel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This morning I received a reply to my JED support ticket -- thank you! Although it is mainly a canned response, I appreciate that it was sent. The bottom line is that I need to resubmit LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m going to resubmit LaSalleMart. But, before I do, I am going to do a few things first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listening to the video, I&#39;m thinking that perhaps my PHP headers referring to the GPL Licence was not sufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I will tweak my builds so that the actual standard wording appears in the header.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, I will unpublish my &quot;all plugins&quot; and &quot;all modules&quot; downloads. And, I will unpublish all modules and plugins that are not tested. There are quite a number of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before this submission, I will clean up a bunch of outstanding issues. This build will be LaSalleMart 2.0.010 -- probably out in mid-June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: see my updated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/lasallemartkb/Change+Log+and+Version+Planner\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart Change Log and Release Planner\">Change Log/Release Planner</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch Matt&#39;s video. He describes the situation his small group of volunteers are in. It&#39;s quite an eye-opener.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Joomla User Group Toronto eCommerce Presentation</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>At last week&#39;s (May 30, 2013) JUGT seminar, I did a presentation about Joomla ecommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See it at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.lasallemart.com/index.php/presentation/16-welcome-to-my-presentation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bob Bloom ecommerce presentation at Joomla User Group Toronto\">http://www.lasallemart.com/index.php/presentation/16-welcome-to-my-presentation</a>&nbsp;(my blog post of it at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/may-2013-joomla-group-toronto-presentation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"My May 2013 Joomla User Group Toronto eCommerce Presentation\">blog.southlasallecommerce.com</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did a rather unconventional presentation, outlining my reasons for users to create their own ecosystem. The second half of my presentation was Q&amp;A based, but there were very few questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My unconventional presentation approach stems from my unconventional approach to my Joomla ecommerce extension. In fact, I realized whilst preparing my presentation that I need to stop straddling my conventional and unconventional approaches, because in so doing I am muddling my message about LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am being so confusing about my message about LaSalleMart that there is no message being communicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I decided that I would put away the conventional and stick with the unconventional. Why? Because it is the unconventional that got me to this point. It is the path less pursued, that I&#39;ve pursued, that has resulted in huge success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, I turned off my public downloads (site updates still work). And, I have a special message on my home page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a request to do another presentation -- this time a pure hands-on workshop building a LaSalleMart site from scratch. Yes, let&#39;s do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Quick Launch Demo</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I mentioned in last month&#39;s podcast I would publish a LaSalleMart &quot;Quick Launch&quot; demo. I put it together, uploaded, then deleted it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I put together a one-off distro that was purposefully crimped, when I am talking about putting together full featured automated Joomla-LaSalleMart distros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, let&#39;s stick to distros, and not have half-assed Joomla-LaSalleMart variations out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Mandrill and Mobile</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking advantage of mobile is taking LaSalleMart on exciting but challenging places. It&#39;s cliche to say &quot;exciting&quot; and &quot;challenging&quot;, but appropriate here. The codebase is set-up strictly for the desktop experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In testing LaSalleMart&#39;s first web application, I took a moment to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/new-mandrill-library-for-lasallemart\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Mandrill Library for Joomla\">create a Mandrill library for Joomla</a>. Mandrill is the way to send Joomla through MailChimp. Joomla tells the Mandrill service that it has an email it wants MailChimp to send out on its behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My web app sent out an email, but how do we know it was really sent? So I created a Mandrill library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before diving into LaSalleMart&#39;s mobile development, I want to pause to catch up on more mundane work first that&#39;s been accumulating. I anticipate resuming work in late June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Framework on Framework</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The Akeeba Framework on Framework is about to become part of my daily existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the brainchild of Nicholas of Akeeba fame, which speeds up Joomla programming. As well, using it is a way of programming a component once but have it work on Joomla 2.5 and 3.x.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I programmed four components in two days, after creating a generic build and update process. This process is not quite finished, and the four components don&#39;t quite work. But this is by design -- to do it is to learn it. So this month I will finish these little components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 for Joomla 3.x will be different than LM2. There will be a lot of little components in the Administrator. My guess is that the existing LaSalleMart library will be discontinued in favour of a fresh new library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vision is starting to come together: Build a ton of itty bitty specialized components on FoF; create a new library to put common LaSalleMart specific functions that all all components can access; create multiple versions of LaSalleMart to create specialized packages that do specific things. For example: a LM package strictly for digital downloads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>On Deck for June</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Boring is the word to describe June&#39;s anticipated development. Lots of little things to clean up but nothing earth shattering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the boring stuff is done, I will look at checkout to see how I can streamline it. And, to see how to approach guest checkout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of the list is re-doing my home page, so it reflects the unconventional approach I am taking to LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(17, 22, 3, 'Lasallemart20', '<p>Welcome to my August 2013 edition of &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello, my name is Bob Bloom, coming to you from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am cheating. I&#39;m behind my August and September podcasts, so I&#39;m catching up with a series of three or four podcasts about LaSalleMart 3 -- instead of going ahead with one super huge podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I expect to receive more referral traffic from the Joomla Extensions Directory than from all other sources combined. &nbsp;To the tune of a 4 to 1 ratio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be candid here, is that it&#39;s better to be self-sufficient than to put ones traffic in so much in the hands of another. On the other hand, why should my wonderful ecommerce extension not be listed on the JED?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, you know something, it&#39;s the talk that LaSalleMart cannot be legitimate in the Joomla world without being listed on the JED, that really swayed me. Why not be perceived as a legit ecomm extension in the Joomla world, and get a ton of referral hits in the process?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I&#39;m glad that I decided to list LaSalleMart 2 on the JED, because I would not know the listing process had I not actually tried to list. It&#39;s been very educational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I read all the listing documentation very carefully, especially the extra directives associated with listing forks of Joomla extensions that already exist in the JED. I complied with everything. In the end, only 19 cosmetic changes were required by JED, for items I missed in the file headers. Hard to bat 1.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I submitted my updates, my updates would not &quot;take&quot; in the JED&#39;s front-end admin. My tickets would not work as well.

(18, 23, 3, 'Lasallemart21', '<p>Welcome to my September 2013 edition of my &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom, from Toronto Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am cheating, catching up with my August and September podcasts by breaking up a huge podcast draft into smaller shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this podcast, I will talk about putting LaSalleMart 2 on ice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2 is my fork of Tienda version 0.10 for Joomla 2.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thrilled that Tienda had a Joomla 2.5 version, I started the re-fork process from scratch after forking LaSalleMart 1 for Joomla 1.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not so thrilled to discover the extent that Tienda&#39;s new Joomla 2.5 version was a work-in-progress. Which means that it did not work. To cut to the chase, I ended up forking software that did not quite work into working software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hoping to take base software and then advance it in a different direction than its founders intended, instead I got the base package to work. Not without a few twists and turns nonetheless, and some refactoring along the way as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a longer than expected journey, LaSalleMart 2 is done. A wonderful base Joomla ecommerce package, with a nice little knowledge base to supplement its administration screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2 is now at the point where it&#39;s time to broaden its functionality, start refactoring the code, and move it to Joomla 3. Exactly where I want it to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except that I&#39;ve concluded that it is better to start fresh than to build out LM2. A startling conclusion!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I suspected for a while that LaSalleMart 3 would be new software not based on existing ecomm software like its predecessors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of building out the huge base component that is LaSalleMart 2, I was whipping up new components to see how well they could augment LaSalleMart 2. It was hardly a subconscious decision to not touch the base. Hardly! It was a conscious avoidance of messing with the existing codebase. My supplementary components were augmenting LaSalleMart 2. But, y&#39;know, at some point, there&#39;s only so much supplementing that can be achieved. Sooner or later, have to deal with the existing codebase that I&#39;m consciously avoiding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 2 is based on software that exquisitely expresses Joomla 1.5. One big core extension is orbited by plugins that extend its functionality. The idea that there is a core, lavishly sprinkled with event triggers that call third party plugins, is completely expressed in Tienda. So we end up with a monstrous single component, orbited by upwards of 60 plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it is so risky now to mess with the core, because it is so monstrous and unwieldy. Change one thing, and something else goes ka-boom. This has happened on many occassions. &nbsp;The core needs a serious code refactor. But, why bother?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After countless hours reverse engineering the core, I started to seriously consider just starting from scratch. My conscious decisions to leave the core alone whilst building LaSalleMart 2 were indications enough that LaSalleMart 3 has to be a new initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It became painfully obvious that I cannot create modern Joomla ecommerce software that is based on Joomla 1.5 code &amp; philosophy. &nbsp;Although I held out hope. However, after the journey to the bottom of the coupon problem; and, after experimenting with new components, it was clear that the best thing was to move on without LaSalleMart 2. Time to break from the forks!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/lasallemartkb/Change+Log+and+Version+Planner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LaSalleMart version 2.0.012&lt;/a&gt; is the final version of LaSalleMart 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LM2 is a wonderful base Joomla 2.5 ecommerce package.

(20, 25, 3, 'Lasallemart23', '<p>Welcome to my November 2013 &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was asked last month, &quot;oh, are you still broadcasting?&quot;. When I replied that I still produce a monthly podcast, I was asked, &quot;is it worth it?&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ab-so-effing-tive-ly, po-so-effing-lute-ly it is worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">As I tell my clients, Google loves fresh original content. Whatever rankings I have I powered by my consistent broadcasting.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no way my authority on Joomla ecommerce would be legit without my broadcasting. I can list whatever I want on LinkedIn, but my regular broadcasting demonstrate a certain familiarity with my specialty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I&#39;ll tell you something. &nbsp;LaSalleMart 3 and LaSalleCMS&#39; moment is coming. As we progress, their two to three year gestation is there in 100-ish podcasts and blog articles. How&#39;s that for different!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although LaSalleMart 3 development slowed down by client work in October, the second prototyping is going well. I am so concerned about using Joomla and the Framework on Framework in a certain way that I&#39;m still testing my approach. So far, it is going very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want LaSalleMart to use Joomla natively, and to use the full power of FoF, to keep the coding clean. I created an initial suite of nine components, three plugins, and one module. How should these related components interact? Does interaction work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of using plugins for shipping and payment methods, I will use components -- something I&#39;ve long wanted to do. &nbsp;Using components exposes the most Joomla technology for LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Joomla 3.2 now released, Joomla 3 will be reset to work with it. For the first time, the Framework on Framework is now included with native Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likely, for the remainder of this year, LaSalleMart will be in its initial development. Yet, before the year closes, my LaSalleMart development group will expand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of ideas I want to try out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One idea is what I call &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Given a matrix of rules, can LaSalleMart create an appropriate checkout on-the-fly? Is it feasible to allow and disallow products to use specific shipping and payment methods? Is it then feasible to allow multiple shipping (and perhaps payment) methods per order? &nbsp;On this side are a lot of business rules. Business rules connect products, buyers, shipping, and payments. I want LaSalleMart to process this matrix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another idea is what I call &quot;The Engines&quot;. The matrix goes into the engine, which in turn propels the checkout. There are the business rules. Then, there is the processing of these rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there are some new concepts to test-drive, along with a fresh way of using Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Joomla 3.2 now released, I will break off some LaSalleMart development time to start-up LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is a long dormant project to create Joomla Distributions. The object of these distributions is to provide integrated LaSalleMart-Joomla packages that provide a holistic Joomla ecommerce experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t want LaSalleMart to feel like an add-on grafted on to Joomla. Rather, I want LaSalleMart to feel snug and proper in Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a LaSalleCMS.com domain, along with a new Joomla 3.1 site that I will have to upgrade. As well, there is an Atlassian open source licence for LaSalleCMS, with my thanks to Atlassian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I&#39;ve tested out my own Joomla distros already, this is the first full scale distribution effort I&#39;ve ever undertaken. So, one of the goals is to actually create distribution(s), even if there is no real functional difference with Joomla itself. Step-by-step! Once the initial distribution mechanics are working, then I want to add a few little touches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a very interesting GitHub thread called &quot;Composer driven distributions for the Joomla CMS&quot; at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/joomla-cms/start-here/issues/11\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"RFC - Composer driven distributions for the Joomla CMS\">https://github.com/joomla-cms/start-here/issues/11</a>. The idea is breaking Joomla into its basic parts, and then using Composer to create a custom Joomla depending on what one&#39;s needs are. So, I will not necessarily be in a rush to actually break Joomla 3.2 into its basic parts -- not that I was going to rush into this, having already decided to wait until the long-term 3.5 version is released. This is an interesting thread because it&#39;s the first time I recollect that the Joomla project is itself considering breaking Joomla up. LaSalleCMS will be well placed for such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the client side, it&#39;s been an interesting month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I finished my first WordPress WooCommerce site. It&#39;s been an interesting contrast to doing Joomla ecommerce. One of the things that astound me about this WordPress site is that the blog is not integrated with the ecommerce. WordPress is, first and foremost, a blogging platform. But, where is the blog? &nbsp;So ecommerce on WordPress is a wonderful melding of ecommerce with blogging? No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I suppose you expect me to say bad things about WordPress ecommerce. No, I am not bad mouthing WordPress ecommerce. Just understand what you are using. If you run a blog and you want to sell a few products, then you need to look at WordPress ecommerce options. An intriguing alternative is to use one of the commercial WordPress form generators instead of an ecommerce plugin, &nbsp;a decision that depends on your needs. The ecommerce sits atop WordPress and does its thing. You have chocolate and peanut butter, but you don&#39;t have peanut butter swirl. Ecomm to the left, blog to the right. This was my biggest disappointment, based on my preconceived notion of what I thought WordPress ecommerce is supposed to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided never again to accept a deposit-plus-final-payment gig again. This arrangement incentivizes someone to hold the final payment hostage in order to extract free labour. Then, at the very end, once free labour is finally with-held, to abscond on the payment anyways. From now on, it&#39;s Progressive Billing only. Pay as you go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a client says to me, &quot;how much to set up my website?&quot;, my answer will now be, &quot;define website&quot;. The real scope is never known in advance -- unless the scope is very very limited. In fact, scope is discovered during development. Waterfall development is so last century!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month I did an ecommerce presentation at the monthly Joomla User Group Toronto workshop. My main message was: build your ecommerce sites backwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a brief podcast -- unlike the last one!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Years-long vision of what Joomla ecommerce should be is coming into fruition. I am chomping at the bit, so subscribe to my blog&#39;s Feedburner to get my new blog articles; and, check out my monthly &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(21, 26, 3, 'Lasallemart24', '<p>Welcome to my December 2013 &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is unusual that I get so excited about non-production, first Alpha, software that is not even available to the public. But, today is that day because the initial Alpha version of LaSalleMart3 is done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 is my Joomla ecommerce technology, built entirely from scratch using Joomla 3.2, and built with the superb Akeeba Framework-on-Framework that now comes with Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking my initial LM3 development into package development releases was not part of my original plan. After doing a detailed pen-and-paper work breakdown diagram, it became clear that breaking the broad from-scratch scope into package milestones was the way to get a handle on creating LaSalleMart3 from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart1 was a fork of a Joomla 1.5 ecommerce extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart2 was a fork of a that extension&#39;s initial -- and for a long while only --Joomla 2.5 iteration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 is different because it is not a fork. It&#39;s completely from scratch, based on Joomla 3 and on FoF. The scope became over-whelming. So I took a step back to get a handle on the scope, which for me always means doing a work breakdown diagram. Yes, there&#39;s a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/lasallemart-3-the-project\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart 3: The Project\">blog post</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, there were many diagrams. Most ended up in the circular file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion: get this baby off the ground first, then worry about widening scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">LM3 is a suite of related components, modules, and plugins. Each using the FoF conventions. Being the first time doing Joomla programming like this, there is a learning curve. Perversely, much learning in what *not* to program -- letting FoF do its thing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One complaint I have with the Joomla ecommerce extensions I&#39;ve used is they crimp Joomla&#39;s natural strengths. I want LM3 to bring out Joomla&#39;s natural strengths, not get in the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla has strong natural front-end capabilities. LM3 should bring out this strategic strength, not get in the way. I want LM3 to be a designer&#39;s paradise, opening up the full significant power of Joomla to designers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, LaSalleMart3 will not -- repeat *not* -- have front-end category and product layout features specific to LM3. Instead, LM3 will leave that to Joomla itself. LM3 will directly integrate with Joomla&#39;s content, opening up the full power of Joomla and its extension library to ecommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means there is a lack of front-end features by design in my initial Alpha release. In a subsequent Alpha release this integration will be realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These initial Alpha releases lack scope on purpose. Or, more precisely, the scope is concentrated in the software development and installation process, rather than in overt features you see in Joomla&#39;s front-end and admin. Forking software is great because there&#39;s all the software pre-existing. But, creating from a blank screen means starting at the beginning. The builds, the repos, the installation routine. Sure, the two LaSalleMart forks required significant efforts in these things. But starting from scratch, and having definite ideas about using FoF and clean code and multiple-small-components, turned into a much bigger effort than I anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">One of the pressure points ended up being the database, which took me by surprise. Joomla components install the database tables they require. The Joomla installation process provides a lot of features to accommodate the installation and maintenance of a component&#39;s database tables. Except that I am doing something I&#39;ve never done before with LM3: components are related! I barely gave this fact a moment&#39;s thought until I started digging into the LM3&#39;s programming.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making related components come to life made me realize that creating one single massive component is ingrained in my Joomla thinking. One of the reasons I had to take a step back, turn off the screens, and get pen-to-paper was to get a handle on what it really means to relate Joomla components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The now-ships-with-Joomla Akeeba Framework on Framework is stunning in its ability to use pieces of FoF-based Joomla components in other FoF-based Joomla components, modules, and plugins. I thought a pre-Alpha proof-of-concept playing around step would educate me on the proper use of FoF for its &quot;HMVC&quot; abilities. Wrong! Only in fullness of the production styled LM3 did I start to understand the full flower of this profound aspect of FoF.&nbsp;So, one of the reasons to create Alpha packages is to learn FoF, the idea being to use a related suite of components together. It does not have to be the full suite of LM3 components, but to start with a core of components, and then to introduce more small components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem at this initial point turned out to be the actual creation of these components. A bit of chicken-and-egg. I need the build, installation and update mechanisms first. Add to this any twists-and-turns associated with creating a related suite of extensions. So, as it turned out, time and effort was lavished on this aspect of LM3, and properly so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key idea that came out of this process of creating related components, modules, and plugins, is that of the flagship component. Each individual component would not -- repeat *not* -- install its associated database tables. Instead, the flagship component will install and maintain the entire database. It&#39;s cleaner to maintain one database than to break it up into pieces so that those database tables relating to specific components are installed by those components. I do not see the benefit of breaking up the database like this, but I do see adding the risk of breaking the database, especially foreign keys and table relationships. So, keeping the database within a flagship component is the way I&#39;m going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A flagship component is the place to put things that do not make sense anywhere else. Such as LaSalleMart-wide settings. I don&#39;t want you to hunt for settings within each component. Rather, just go to the flagship component for all the settings. The only exception so far is the Live Update settings, which is done once at a component&#39;s installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want specific history reporting of individual LM3 extension&#39;s installation, updating, and un-installation. This will be done in the flagship component. This reporting ended up needing unexpected love and attention in the installation routine. Every LaSalleMart3 site will be like raindrops: no two will be the same. It will be important know the specific installation history to diagnose problems, so now is the time to get the installation routine settled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flagship component then becomes first amongst equals. Its existence is necessary for the entire LM3 installation, without which no other LM3 extension will work. Not to say that there are no other critical LM3 extensions, because there are already a dozen other components, modules, and plugins that truly comprise the LM3 &quot;core&quot;. However, when one component is responsible for the entire database, there is an unusual ability to destroy LM3 with one little uninstall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My worry is mistakenly uninstalling the flagship component. It&#39;s not malicious behaviour that I worry about. It&#39;s my panicked clients clicking the wrong extension at oh-dark-hundred while catching up on their email that I worry about. Even for myself, it sure would be nice to have some type of fail-safe to prevent me from mistakenly taking out my entire LM3 database laden with live data that has yet to be captured by the nightly backup run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I customized the installation routine of each LM3 component, module, and plugin to ensure that the flagship component is the first component to be installed; and, the last component to be un-installed. You can mistakenly zap anything else with ease, don&#39;t get me wrong! But, all other LM3 extensions must be zapped first before you can uninstall the flagship component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My initial solution to enable this feature was messy. I very much want clean code, using the native abilities of Joomla and FoF as much as possible to achieve clean code. So I halted my messy solution and asked myself what Joomla could offer my problem. And the answer is the &quot;protection&quot; field in the extensions database table. So I scrapped my messy code completely and created cleaner code that changed this native Joomla field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrapping code was a common experience while creating Alpha1. Time and again, FoF precluded the need for code. The trick was to set up LM3 so FoF could just do its thing. Y&#39;know, I really did not believe that I did not need to code all sorts of stuff in the model (the &quot;M&quot; in &quot;MVC&quot;). I would pore over the FoF source code to see if it &quot;really&quot; had the code to do what I wanted. Yes, it does. Yes, scrap the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trick is to structure components to use FoF. The trick is to be very straight-ahead with setting up components, instead of getting cute with the coding. Sure, I could just whip up a component, whip up a database, and whip up the code. But, using FoF this &quot;whip up&quot; stuff does not work. To receive the full benefits of FoF, my components have to be structured to use FoF. Either I use FoF, or I do not use FoF. There is no halfway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no sense using FoF, while resisting it because it demands rigorous structuring of the components. Which is what I noticed I was doing. Which translated into subverting FoF, which I could see was producing the worst of all possible worlds. Which forced me to be honest about using FoF early on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of my putting pen-to-paper exercise was committing to FoF wholly. The benefits far outweigh the costs -- so much so that wrote a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/technicalnotes/Framework+on+Framework\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"My Framework on Framework Technical Notes\">compose an Ode to Joy for FoF</a>, on top of my years of writing and podcasting about FoF. Yet, here in the practice, I needed a final acceptance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key idea behind LM3 Alpha packages is to use FoF in a production-like setting. I need to force a production-like setting in order to confront FoF specific issues early. Better to learn now, rather than to have to do significant refactoring later. Obviously, this is the first time I&#39;ve used FoF on a grand scale. Originally, I did not care about getting LM3 off the ground as a series of Alpha release packages. Fully accepting FoF changed my outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard on the heels of changing my initial development to a series of milestone Alpha packages was confronting exactly how to use pieces of other FoF-based components in another FoF-based component. And so entered a new word into my lexicon: &quot;MVC Triad&quot;, which is an elemental way that extensions relate to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it is imperative that LM3 extensions maintain strict FoF discipline. Which is causing me to look at my extensions in a different way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way I look at extensions differently is that I really want components, because Joomla and FoF bring the most goodness to bear on components, not plugins and modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look at plugins and modules with narrow scope, fulfilling stricter narrror roles. One of these roles is as a conduit for MVC Triads resident in components. In fact, I am now biased to place the bulk of a plugin and module&#39;s functionality in a component. For example, the cart module is very thin, it&#39;s purpose to place cart information in module positions. Putting the views in a cart component means that these views are available to other extensions. Which means that I do not necessarily need a module to view a module! So, without writing any extra code, I can expose a cart module within a component when buyers are using the iPad. Thank you FoF! &nbsp;It&#39;s going to be very handy having that view resident in the cart component, rather than in a module, when we create web applications using Joomla&#39;s own little known CLI facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 Alpha1 is comprised of nine components, one module, and three plugins:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>flagship LaSalleMart component;</li>\r\n	<li>address management component;</li>\r\n	<li>cart component;</li>\r\n	<li>checkout component;</li>\r\n	<li>coupon component;</li>\r\n	<li>order component;</li>\r\n	<li>payment component;</li>\r\n	<li>product&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:13px\">component;</span></li>\r\n	<li>shipping&nbsp;component;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>cart module;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>add-to-cart plugin;</li>\r\n	<li>system plugin;</li>\r\n	<li>user plugin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>No, these components lack full functionality. The lack even partial functionality. But their build, installation, and upgrading processes are pretty good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are designed as a suite of related extensions with a flagship component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data model is designed for strict FoF usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product component does product creation and display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product component displays products on the front-end, along with an add-to-cart form. This form comes from the cart component -- not from the product component, nor from a plugin! This form successfully directs the flow to the cart component where the database cart table record is created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the payment and shipping component views are not done in Alpha1, it is sufficient that the product and cart components&#39; integration be established for this milestone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, the order component successfully updates multiple database tables in FoF fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sense, I&#39;ve &quot;mocked&quot; the production environment for FoF usage, to establish the way in which FoF should be used to effect relationships amongst the individual extensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF delivers as advertised. I am thrilled at the results, and am thrilled at the opportunities it opens up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Alpha1 represents the tangible establishment of LaSalleMart 3&#39;s development. Along with the establishment of my Joomla Distro called LaSalleCMS.com, LaSalleMart 3 has kicked off for real.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I have my new Joomla Distro set-up. Based on Joomla 3.2, it&#39;s at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lasallecms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleCMS.com\">LaSalleCMS.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS launch is done:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>the builds;</li>\r\n	<li>the updating -- there is a pending problem, but want to see Joomla 3.7.1 out before diving in... using com_installer instead of com_joomlaupdate works;</li>\r\n	<li>setting up JIRA issues, using the Atlassian Open Source Licence;</li>\r\n	<li>setting up Confluence collaboration and knoweldge base site,&nbsp;, using the Atlassian Open Source Licence;</li>\r\n	<li>public LaSalleCMS repos on LaSalleMart&#39;s BitBucket account, because it&#39;s easier for me this way!</li>\r\n	<li>LaSalleCMS.com is set up, using my Distro (of course).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In the short-term, it is now more important to focus on LaSalleMart 3&#39;s development. So LaSalleCMS will enjoy a leisurely development for the time being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla updates will be incorporated into LaSalleCMS -- and it will be a great learning opportunity how to actually do these, as opposed to knowing theoretically how to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needs that arise can be addressed right away, because LaSalleCMS is set-up. If LaSalleMart needs something done in Joomla, can get to it immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to fund ongoing monthly LaSalleCMS development through LaSalleMart subscriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to sneak in a word about WordPress 3.7&#39;s new automatic updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While looking for the setting to completely disable auto updates, I discovered that there is no such setting. One has to directly modify the wp-config.php file &nbsp;(<a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/25/the-definitive-guide-to-disabling-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7/\" target=\"_blank\">http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/25/the-definitive-guide-to-disabling-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7/</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion, WordPress is now really geared towards the consumer. In contrast, Joomla 3.2 is skewed towards those who value software producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MoneyBall of Free Open Source Software is software creation, not software consumption. There is tremendous value in your ability to write code. Ability does not mean you personally write code -- it means that you set your site up for software creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The fabulous Akeeba Subscriptions coming to end-of-life.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The excellent article at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.akeebabackup.com/home/news/55-general/1534-the-future-of-akeebasubs.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.akeebabackup.com/home/news/55-general/1534-the-future-of-akeebasubs.html</a>&nbsp;presents a real-world case study on software development. &nbsp;What I like about this article is the honesty about the costs of software development. All those payment plugins that come with Akeeba Sub are enormously expensive -- not just to create, but to maintain.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve spent nearly four years in its development but it is still not making enough money to cover its month-to-month costs for development, maintenance and support &ndash; let alone cover the costs of the time we have already spent on it. We&rsquo;ve tried very hard to make it sustainable but no matter what we tried we failed. Akeeba Subscriptions has been a big black hole, sucking our resources and hampering...&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>AkeebaSubs is superb software. It&#39;s integration with the Akeeba Software Release System is fabulous and valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to incorporate Akeeba Subscriptions into LaSalleMart 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want LaSalleMart subscription revenue to support this effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">I always had it in mind to integrate AkeebaSubs into LaSalleMart&#39;s checkout.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">What I have in mind is that the &nbsp;ecommerce side of AkeebaSubs be omitted completely. Its checkout, coupons, payments, and invoicing will be taken care of by LaSalleMart itself. The subscriptions aspect of AkeebaSubs becomes a new component called LaSalleMart Subscriptions, which controls site access and administers the actual subscriptions.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to preserve the integration with the Akeeba Release System, which I consider a secret weapon for digital downloads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">---</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3&#39;s Alpha2 milestone release will have a basic checkout flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be shipping and payment steps, along with order confirmation and thank you steps. The checkout component will drive the checkout process. The shipping component will drive the shipping process, although for Alpha2 only a rudimentary process is expected. Similar for payments, the payment component will drive the payment step although only a rudimentary payment process is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to establish the relationship between these components during checkout, not to provide production-grade functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuller cart functionality is part of Alpha2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What may not be part of Alph2 is address management, which will likely be deferred for Alpha3. Address management is an intense feature. I&#39;d rather get these Alpha milestone releases done sooner than later; and, focus them on specific features and issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Administrator side will be weak with Alpha2, but the front-end side of Alpha2 should be at the point where you can take LaSalleMart3 through checkout yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want LaSalleMart3 designed to utlize the fullness of Joomla 3 with the Framework on Framework. So far, this philosophy is coming to fruition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla with FoF opens up possibilities to deal with what I consider are the two major ecommerce challenges facing the small e-business owner:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>mobile;</li>\r\n	<li>customer engagement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sense, these are one combined issue. In which case, I would simple call it &quot;Customer Engagement&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my mind, LaSalleMart3 is mobile first. The demands of mobile are very intense, intertwined as it is with the imperative to properly engage your customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see &quot;mobile&quot; and &quot;customer engagement&quot; as strategic opportunities for your e-business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a plethora of limited scope Joomla components, keeping the code clean and straightforward, and keeping Joomla&#39;s front-end power accessible, allows us to innovate with Joomla-FoF and LaSalleMart3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This topic deserves its own podcast. The imperative now is to keep LaSalleMart3&#39;s development on the tact it is now on, as my proof-of-concept and &quot;mock&quot; production environment work is affirming that my design vision for LaSalleMart3 is bearing fruit in the mobile-first era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can already see that LaSalleMart3 will be most attractive to e-business owners who invest back into their sites with ongoing development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those that want a simple fire-and-forget ecommerce site, perhaps we&#39;ll have to consider creating &quot;LaSalleMart3 Lite&quot;. Philosophically, I think offering a software-as-a-service type of LaSalleMart3 crimps the value of LM3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is tremendous value in seeing your website as a software development entity, not as a software complete end-point. I call this the &quot;Moneyball&quot; of value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way I see it, LaSalleMart3 is most valuable to a group of software creators as a way to amortize the significant costs of creating software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation costs money, but its money well spent in order to reap outsized returns that are not available to those who wait for others to create these innovations. Those on the forefront are not necessarily in a hurry to release their innovations to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing a relatively small group of people together to amortize the cost of development and innovation is still the way I envision progressing LaSalleMart -- and LaSalleCMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am kicking around the idea of using Kickstarter -- although the idea does not excite me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What excites me is working with a group more intimately involved with development. Just as a client is intimately involved one-on-one with the development I do for them, I see this type of engagement as the standard for how my group develops LaSalleMart technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional idea of providing support seems rather unattached to me. I prefer we be involved in the development together, which itself requires a higher level of engagement than filling out support tickets. Again, underlying my outlook is my belief that software creation itself holds intrinsic value not available to those who merely consume software. So, approaching support as part of the development process encapsulates a higher value intrinsically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is why I have Atlassian set up for LaSalleMart (and LaSalleCMS), as it is a development-biased way to collaborate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is why I conclude that the best way to progress with LaSalleMart development is to grow a close development group based on a modest monthly subscription cost,&nbsp;<em>capping</em>&nbsp;the number of members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, I prefer a development group, not a customer group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">My call to action to you is for you to become part of my development group.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2013/lasallemart3-initial-alpha-release-achieved\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart3 Initial Alpha Release Achieved\">Blog post: LaSalleMart3 Initial Alpha Release Achieved</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(23, 28, 3, 'Lasallemart26', '<p>Welcome to my February 2014 &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of each month, I podcast about my Joomla ecommerce technology I am developing from scratch with Joomla 3.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no action right now with my Joomla Distribution, LaSalleCMS, which is in abeyance until LaSalleMart3 version one-point-oh is released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A week or so ago I published my first ever LaSalleMart3 demo site at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lasallemart.com/alpha2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart3 Alpha2 Demo Site\">http://LaSalleMart.com/Alpha2</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Alpha releases are described in my blog post,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2014/lasallemart-revised-alphas\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart: Revised Alphas\">LaSalleMart: Revised Alphas</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the public can see my demo site&#39;s front-end, only a handful of people have access to its Administrator back-end. Only one person had direct feedback. I think my little band is telling me in their silence to just keep plugging away to a production version that they can sink their teeth into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what an unexpected comment from the one feedback I did get! Listen to this: perhaps I should use a standard ecommerce data model! Or, perhaps, use the Magento data model. Why re-invent the wheel! Just as I&#39;m about to buid out LaSalleMart&#39;s data model I get this most unusual feedback -- the demo site is not about the database at all. My demo site is about bringing LaSalleMart out of the shop. In no way can anyone see the database. Well, how&#39;s that for taking the road less travelled!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I was none to happy to be advised to grab some off-the-shelf data model. I&#39;ve already looked at the Magento data model, as well as a number of other ones, but I looked again. No, not going to use any of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out that I&#39;m about to build out the bulk of LaSalleMart3&#39;s data model -- this week&#39;s three hour exercise -- oops! So, the counsel was certainly topical. But, I want to tell you all out there something: LaSalleMart3 is ecommerce technology for Joomla!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 is not designed to sit on top of Joomla, and then forget that Joomla is there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 is not supposed to be an all-inclusive feature set replacing Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 is not designed to end up as something that will eventually be use-able on the other open source packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 is not supposed to be some impenetrable thing that does funny things with Joomla in order to dissuade you from messing with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 is made for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of truncating Joomla&#39;s goodness, or supplanting Joomla&#39;s goodness, or getting in the way of Joomla&#39;s goodness, LaSalleMart3 is made to bring out the power and glory that is Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a Joomla consultant specializing in Joomla ecommerce. My ecommerce software is made specifically for Joomla. My LaSalleMart relies on Joomla&#39;s powerful strengths for its heart and soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why my Alpha2 demo site showcases Joomla articles as product pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, my data model is going to be Joomla oriented. Not Magento oriented, not anything-else oriented. LaSalleMart3 is ecommerce technology for Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla 3.2 comes with the superb Akeeba Framework for Joomla. I find that its actual name, the Framework on Framework, elicits ice cold glazed looks, so I am now going to call it &quot;The Akeeba Framework for Joomla&quot;. But my short form acronym will still be &quot;FoF&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoF is having an absolutely profound impact on LaSalleMart3. And the data model is no exception. It is imperative that LaSalleMart3&#39;s data model comply with FoF conventions. The result is a data model with a distinct personality. It is almost a branding exercise, because the FoF conventions are so identifiable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week I commenced work on my next Alpha release. Basically, I decided to combine the next couple of Alpha releases into one, since the features are intimately related. The first thing to do, then, is to do the next build out of the data model. Honestly, I thought it would be done by noon last Monday. Hahahahahahahahaha! It is Friday and I&#39;ve still to hammer the thing out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until now, I&#39;ve been using MySQL Workbench to visually draw the data model and print the SQL. I&#39;ve had my eye on a commercial database product -- no, I am not going to name it -- with which to build out my data model and perform other database functions. It has a Linux version, so I download the trial and guess what? The Linux version is just the Windows version with files that allow Windows software to run on Linux -- some of you know about Wine. Spelled like the alcoholic beverage, but pronounced like a certain developer kvetching. So, basically, I said &quot;no way&quot;. That&#39;s how Linux-ed I am now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, just when I thought the issue of database software was settled -- I had checked out such software for a long while -- I&#39;m software-less. So back again I was reviewing db software. Which led me back to -- yup! -- Oracle&#39;s MySQL Workbench. I installed their version 6.1 beta -- and I am sticking with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, I confronted surprise database issues. Which led to new review of the native Joomla database, the databases of all FoF software, a review of the LaSalleMart2 database, and a crash course in MySQL indexes and constraints. Which is how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://southlasalle.atlassian.net/wiki/display/lasallemart3/LaSalleMart3%27s+FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart 3 FAQ\">&quot;What is MySQL?&quot; ended up on my LaSalleMart3 Knowledge Base FAQ</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, I never quite noticed this before: Joomla&#39;s native database does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;use foreign keys (<a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/ansi-diff-foreign-keys.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MySQL foreign keys\">link1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-foreign-key-constraints.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MySQL InnoDb foreign key constraints\">link2</a>). I&#39;ve looked at the SQL a zillion times, but never quite noticed before. No CASCADE DELETE ON, no foreign keys. All the indexes really refer to search fields available in the Administrator, not to fields specified in other tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Referential integrity is enforced in the Joomla code, not in the database. Well, that&#39;s what I concluded without looking at the code, because the alternative is not having referential integrity -- which I really doubt!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FoF databases do not have foreign keys either. What was interesting was one database having a &quot;slug&quot; field as a unique key -- which threw me on a research tangent. Aren&#39;t alias fields by their very nature unique? Wrong! It is very possible to have aliases with the same name in the same database. Unless uniqueness is enforced in the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart2 does have foreign keys. But, if I am following FoF conventions, and as ecommerce technology for Joomla, should LaSalleMart3 dispense with foreign keys?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, this is how a week zips on by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s what I am going to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am definitely going to comply with the FoF conventions. However, these conventions do not specify the use of foreign keys, keys, and unique keys. The one exception is the primary key, which is present in each and every table ipso facto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am going to create an index for fields that are searchable -- which is how Joomla does it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am going to use foreign keys, because I do want database level referential integrity. One reason -- or perhaps, rationalization -- is to prevent developers inadvertently deleting records that are associated with other records in other tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question, then, is using CASCADE DELETEs. If I delete an order, do I then delete child order records at the database level? I am not sure, but I will likely build &#39;em in and see what happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which leads me to mull something else that I&#39;ve been avoiding -- on purpose! Do I use MySQL&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/triggers.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MySQL triggers\">triggers</a>? MySQL is very powerful, but in the Joomla-verse, triggers are rarely, if ever used. However, I am thinking about it! If the opportunity presents itself, I will likely create a trigger. One reason is simply pedagogical: to learn to use triggers inside a custom component. We&#39;ll see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you who are shuddering at my marrying LaSalleMart3 to MySQL, I have absolutely no qualms whatsoever at this betrothal. MySQL is a LaSalleMart3 requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will have my eye on MySQL features. And so I&#39;m sure to be digging ever deeper into MySQL Workbench.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart3 version one-point-oh will be another month. However, in saying this, I doubt it will be delayed beyond that. There really is not any more scope creep that can creep in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really wanted to be bare-bones about the initial production version. However, there are two reasons my bare-bones feature set is not working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, I was to release such a bare-bones version that no one would actually use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, I need some inter-depended features in there now to properly build the software. It&#39;s not enough to build a hook to coupons. I need to build a bare-bones coupon now so I can get that to work with product pricing in order to properly construct the pricing algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, basically, I&#39;m building the bulk of LaSalleMart3&#39;s one-point-oh version now, instead of creating separate Alpha releases. And, I&#39;m adding to the scope which adds to the timing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve added the scope that I am going to add. There is no more scope to add for version one-point-oh. So in the absence of scope creep, I&#39;m sticking to &quot;just another month&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coupons were not supposed to be in version one-point-oh, but now there will be basic coupons. Very basic!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was mulling just including the Canadian taxes in version one-point-oh, but now there will be Canadian, Floridian, and Californian taxes included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What will be glaringly missing from one-point-oh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, shippers and payment processors. Yeah, that&#39;s going to be glaring. But, well, these really need one-point-oh to exist first anyways. I anticipate that I&#39;ll be working on a PayPal Standard component after one-point-oh&#39;s release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downloadable products will be missing. Subscriptions will be missing. However, we can cheat using two Akeeba software packages. I&#39;ll have more on this when we get to that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s it for this February&#39;s episode of&nbsp;<em>LaSalleMart News</em>. Updates will be posted on my blog. I tweet here-and-there during the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, I will be at the February 19th Joomla User Group Toronto workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">---</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(26, 31, 3, 'Lasallemart29', '<p>Welcome to my May 2014 &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of each month, I update you on LaSalleMart and on my other projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month I wanted to stay heads-down programming LaSalleMart 3.0, so I basically cancelled my last month&#39;s podcast. I have lots to update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing I want to do is let you know where LaSalleMart 3.0 is at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3.0 is my from-scratch Joomla Series 3 ecommerce technology. It is married to the superb Akeeba Framework on Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>products are done;</li>\r\n	<li>integration with native Joomla articles is done;</li>\r\n	<li>cart is done;</li>\r\n	<li>coupons are done;</li>\r\n	<li>Canadian HST/GST/PST is done.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The other taxes I did for LaSalleMart 2.0 are waiting in the wings: California, Florida, and North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I succeeded in programming Joomla components that talk to each other, but in figuring out how best to do this I ended up doing code re-writes. Although it seemed at first like something I should defer for the sake of getting my first production release done, I knew that I had to nail this stuff now because future code depends on this code. No doubt that this re-writing -- actually, a re-re-re-writing exercise, meant not releasing by April month-end. My code is much more organized now, &nbsp;and a little leaner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still to go are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>user registration;</li>\r\n	<li>address management;</li>\r\n	<li>a single, very basic, manual shipping method;</li>\r\n	<li>a single, very basic, manual payment method;</li>\r\n	<li>order processing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The components and database tables are already done for these. &nbsp;The cart&#39;s database tables mimick the order tables, so not creating order processing from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the Memorial Day long weekend, it should be completed. The wildcard is my taking a detour with the Laravel Framework. More on this shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>----</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did a custom Bootstrap 3 template for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lasallemart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart.com\">LaSalleMart.com</a>. &nbsp;Hey, look, no menus! No module positions too. Imagine! First time I&#39;ve done such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are ten new screencasts about LaSalleMart 3.0 on the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I moved my blog to my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://southlasalle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SouthLaSalle dot com\">SouthLaSalle</a>&nbsp;domain. Oh, it feels good having my blog on my flagship domain. Can you believe I had no site on this domain?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I posted about a dozen new articles. Check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I attended the Atlassian Road Show late last month. Atlassian is a code-in-the-cloud company based in Sydney, Australia. They are growing, their offerings are getting deeper as well as expanding, they have a growing reseller network that they call &quot;Atlassian Experts&quot;. After an extensive search, about two years ago I decided to use Atlassian. Glad I did. Right now I use their BitBucket dot com for software repositories, their JIRA issue tracker and workflow driver, and their Confluence collaboration website offering. I use Confluence for my Knowledge Base. I really do not need to use Atlassian at all up to this point; but, for future collaborative and distributed software development, Atlassian will be indispensible. So, I wanted to get on it to learn how to use it -- like everything else, the learning never stops. As we scale into Atlassian, it won&#39;t be cheap! Next area to get into is their Bamboo software build tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone knows that I love the Akeeba Backup extension for Joomla. Along with Akeeba Admin Tools, Akeeba Release System, Akeeba Subscriptions, and the Akeeba Ticket System -- and of course the Akeeba Framework on Framework. Last month they released a fascinating program for WordPress, called the Akeeba Backup for WordPress plugin. It works great, I have it on my own WordPress sites now. Yesterday I installed the Akeeba Backup &quot;Solo&quot; version for generic PHP websites -- worked smooth as silk the first time, including my CRON job. Bravo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Included with these new flavours of Akeeba Backup is the &quot;AWF&quot; framework, &nbsp;a version that Akeeba is slating for official public release in the fall. Having an advanced look at the AWF is very interesting, especially having stared at FOF for so long. Very interesting how it supports a completely independent program without Joomla -- or WordPress or anything -- at all. Yet, what I see on my screen is very familiar. This is very instructive -- and fascinating. I can see using the new Akeeba Framework (I don&#39;t know what the official name will be).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3.0 will not be available to the public. It will not be listed on the Joomla Extensions Directory. It will not be offered through the WordPress Plugin directory. It will not be sold in a boat, nor in a moat. There will not be $19.99 monthly subscriptions to the public. LaSalleMart 3.0 is not a consumer oriented product, so it&#39;s not conducive to offer it in consumer channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3.0 is still nascent anyways. Better that its development be advanced by a group of people committed to its progression -- that&#39;s what it needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3.0 will be offered to my clients, who in turn will help advance its development. In so doing, we can continue to innovate, and to test our innovations on real sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having the power of software creation gives us tremendous ability to go off the beaten path when devising solutions to intense customer engagement, conversion, checkout workflow, among other challenges. This is where the focus will remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially, my private client group will be a software club, with each client paying a monthly &quot;vig&quot; to cover&nbsp;Atlassian among other costs. My clients will joint sponsor features -- which there&#39;s one major feature cooking now but too early to talk about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want my clients e-business value to grow. With LaSalleMart 3.0 and a private software club, I can offer a unique way in which to pursue this elusive goal for my clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>----</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I am doing is really not for everyone. I know this very well. But it is very very good for a few people, and of course for me. With the right people, we will succeed very nicely. Right now, on the very cusp of re-igniting my professional consultancy, we are but a few, but very wonderful people involved. True professionals, smart, some are even good looking! Everyone is cost conscious, and some are interested in being pitched shared feature sponsorship. They are not looking at bullshit propositions from me, they expect a quality pitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I figure at most inviting a dozen power end-user clients; and, maybe three dozen other consultants. Quality, not quantity, baby!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each client within my private consulting group will pay a &quot;vig&quot;. You know? Those very few already on the inside are paying this vig. It is $36CDN/month, and I am adament about this vig. It is the fairest, and cheapest, way for me to pay for software development infrastructure, R&amp;D, and common features (some, not all). Otherwise, there is the tendency for a small group of clients to shoulder the cost of base things that benefit everyone, which is not fair. Also, it is important to delineate inside-vs-outside. We are a small group on the inside, and the rest of the world is on the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things that I want to happen is grow a superb cadre of professional consultants who really know LaSalleMart. It will help me cope with what will&nbsp;be a growing base of LaSalleMart sites. It means that other peoples&#39; clients do not necessarily have to be in our private client group to benefit from LaSalleMart, although by definition they are within our eco-system. I &nbsp;look at the reseller concept as the model of how to proceed, that there will be outstanding professionals who install, train, and develop it. In return, clients and professionals see LaSalleMart as professional type of operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>----</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, now for an important announcement: LaSalleMart is spreading its technological wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key event that triggered this decision was the Joomla project&#39;s announcement last month that it is changing its versioning policy. Changing the versioning policy does not bother me in itself; but, announcing the change without providing the details of the actual policy -- yes, that bothers me. In fact, it scared me a great deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every major Joomla version has obsoleted the Joomla ecommerce extension I specialized in, which has had, shall we say, a negative impact on my growing professional consultancy. The Joomla 3.5 &quot;Long Term Version&quot; that is upcoming is a critical assurance to me that my family&#39;s huge investment in developing LaSalleMart will produce ROI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Joomla project announced the cancellation of the long term version, without adequately enunciating what would take its place. I thought that I had missed something so I confirmed that, indeed, one version policy was cancelled without explaining what the new version policy would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, yes, I reacted viscerally, and&nbsp;unapologetically so. Fear welled instantly, and deeply. The subsequent official policy explanation was rather dense with text and badly formatted, which inspired a new visceral reaction. If my eyes are glazing over, imagine my clients!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, I understand that what&#39;s come out of this is the idea that the entire Joomla 3.x series from here will be one-click updates from one version to another. But, deep down, I am asking myself what is really going on. If Joomla 3.2 to Joomla 3.3 is a one click upgrade, and Joomla 3.3 to Joomla 3.4 is a one-click upgrade, then why change the official policy. Commit to a long term version, and if there are improvements after version 3.5 that are one click away that won&#39;t break anything, then don&#39;t fix what ain&#39;t broke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deep deep down, I feel that I know what&#39;s coming, and what&#39;s coming is what I fear: that LaSalleMart will become obsolete within the Joomla 3 series. My fear is that, by taking away the vital discipline of an explicitly named &quot;Long Term Version&quot;, the probability of LaSalleMart becoming obsolete within the current three-point-x series is increasing. In the name of modernizing the underneath code, at some point backwards compatibility will be impossible. And, now here&#39;s the kicker... the Framework on Framework works with the existing Joomla &quot;platform&quot; residing in the existing Joomla. However, the FOF is not designed to work with the Joomla Framework. So, the Joomla&nbsp;tweaking from Joomla version to version within the Joomla 3 series is something FOF will intermediate as best it can; but, the introduction of aspects of the Joomla Framework into Joomla will not necessarily be intermediated by FOF -- and that is not good for me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to know the extent of my fear? I have followed the progress of the independent frameworks over the years. However, I&#39;ve not used them myself. Yet, I will select one for LaSalleMart and dive into it. Then, I will dive into innovating a connection between WordPress and the framework I selected. This course of action I now consider safer remaining on the tack I was on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;independent PHP Framework I&#39;ve selected is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://laravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Laravel Framework\">Laravel</a>, and I&#39;m putting myself through a crash course of sorts. There are some pretty good video tutorials on YouTube, and I&#39;m catching on thanks to the intensity of my learning the Framework on Framework. Except that this time I&#39;m not learning something that it intimately tied to Joomla; rather, I am learning something that is used by the wider PHP community to build web applications -- which is what Laravel is specifically designed to do. And in so learning Laravel, I see tremendous opportunities opening up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla has a public facing front-end; and, an administrative back-end. The admin and processing will reside in Laravel; and, then using RESTful API calls, the Joomla front-end will access LaSalleMart-Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I can do this arrangement for Joomla, then I can do this arrangement for WordPress too, since WordPress, like Joomla, has a front-end and a back-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, if I can achieve this arrangement for WordPress, then there are other benefits that acrrue, which I am very interested in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, I wanted to bring WordPress&#39; strength in blogging and e-broadcasting to LaSalleMart-Joomla. Now, I will bring the ecommerce to WordPress&#39; blogging and e-broadcasting, saving me the trouble of worrying about exactly how to get native WordPress strengths into Joomla. Now I can build the high value-added ecommerce piece, and meld it into WordPress -- I&#39;m sure I will do some custom coding for this -- and so have a, ideally, unified e-commerce and e-broadcast platform. A very powerful combination!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, WordPress holds a commanding market share. 60% of CMS installs are WordPress. To further solidify this market share, WordPress just announced (May 05) a new $160 million financing --&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Funding for Automattic\">New Funding for Automattic</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-is-raising-160m-in-new-funding\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic Is Raising $160M in New Funding</a>&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I do not like WordPress&#39; automatic updating, I turn this off in the wp-config.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not want to build LaSalleMart as a WordPress plugin, but using Laravel and then bringing it into WordPress&#39; front-end is an attractive proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am hardly a stranger to WordPress, it is a hidden competency. This site and my blog are WordPress sites. Both use the Genesis Framework for WordPress, and both use the same child theme that I&#39;ve customized (naturally). In particular I have great success with my iTunes plugin. My first major ongoing site was a WordPress site. So I&#39;ve had a hand in WordPress for about as long as Joomla -- 6 or 7 years (yikes!). Along the way I&#39;ve wrriten some plugins. Last fall I worked with WooCommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, officially now, I will &quot;do WordPress&quot; for clients. Not to mention work on LaSalleMart for WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>----</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I talk about this new WordPress funding? I want to quote the WordPress founder and CEO&#39;s blog, which I&#39;ve linked to above:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(20, 20, 18)\">I&rsquo;ll start with the big stuff: Automattic is raising $160M, all primary, and it&rsquo;s the first investment into the company since 2008. This is obviously a lot of money, especially considering everything we&rsquo;ve done so far has been built on only about $12M of outside capital over the past 8 years. It was also&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/automattic-secondary/\" style=\"color: rgb(212, 68, 16);\">only a year ago I said</a><span style=\"color:rgb(20, 20, 18)\">&nbsp;&ldquo;Automattic is healthy, generating cash, and already growing as fast as it can so there&rsquo;s no need for the company to raise money directly &mdash; we&rsquo;re not capital constrained.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, they received series &quot;A&quot; funding of $5 million, then &quot;B&quot; funding of $7 million, if memory serves. Wow, is it that far ago already? The money went, in part, to the care and feeding of revenue producing assets such as WordPress dot com (dot org is where you download WordPress).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(20, 20, 18)\">I was wrong, but I didn&rsquo;t realize it until&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\" style=\"color: rgb(212, 68, 16);\">I took on the CEO role in January</a><span style=\"color:rgb(20, 20, 18)\">. Things were and are going well, but there was an opportunity cost to how we were managing the company toward break-even, and we realized we could invest more into WordPress and our products to grow faster. Also our cash position wasn&rsquo;t going to be terribly strong especially after a number of infrastructure and product investments this and last year. So part of my 100-day plan as CEO was to figure out what new funding could look like and we found a great set of partners who believe in our vision for how the web should be and how we can scale into the opportunity ahead of us...</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Great term, opportunity cost. Managing for break-even actually cost them money, because they did not -- I suppose -- invest in R&amp;D which in turn would have generated more revenue. It was not really a matter of raising the money as much as finding the right investment partner. You do not put a 100 day plan to raise financing if you know you cannot raise dollar one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You want to know how expensive the proper software development infrastructure is? An outfit like WordPress had to raise money to invest in it properly, without which it would not be able to create the actual software it wants to create. So, when I hit you up for the vig, keep this in mind!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m sure WordPress wants to invest in Continuous Development, which requires an intense commitment. You understand more my long lead-in with Atlassian?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress&#39; parent company is now valued at $1.16 billion!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been a long while since I&#39;ve looked at Joomla market share.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Usage of content management systems for websites\">This site lists share of content management systems</a>. WordPress has 60% of all content systems. Repeat: 60%. Every other content system shares the remaining 40%. Joomla is second with an 8.4% share of content systems used. But...&nbsp;<a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-joomla/all/all\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Usage statistics and market share of Joomla for websites\">half the Joomla sites are using Joomla version 1</a>, which is not even supported any more. 43% are in version 2, and 10% are in version 3. Over the last year, Joomla&#39;s overall share is decrementing. Really, I thought the numbers were higher. Looks like we&#39;re a long way from this&nbsp;<a href=\"http://community.joomla.org/august-2008/article/519-cms-market-share-report-joomla-in-top-3.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2008 CMS Market Share Report\">2008 article on Joomla dot org</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.symphonythemes.com/content/where-do-drupal-joomla-and-wordpress-go-after-3-years\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal, Joomla and WordPress -- 2008 to 2010 comparison\">Interesting comparison from 2008 to 2010 in this article</a>.

There this year-end review,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://despreneur.com/cms-trends-for-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CMS Trends for 2014\">CMS Trends for 2014</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We are used to see the TOP3 of WordPress, Drupal and Joomla. And this will change. If not in 2014 then still pretty soon. And the reason is that the market share of Drupal and Joomla is [sic] shrinking for the last 6 months.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve been experiencing Joomla&#39;s market share decline in a more organic way: constant discussion at Joomla meet-ups about WordPress, more and more Joomla related business diversifying out of Joomla (the template clubs offered WordPress themes a while ago, and&nbsp;now Akeeba Backup with a new WordPress version of its flagship offering), a whisper from a staunch Joomla-ist offering a WordPress version of their extension (because you can&#39;t argue with market share), ongoing requests by clients to get into WordPress ecommerce...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I&#39;m getting into WordPress ecommerce, by way of Laravel. Opens up a lot of opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress&#39; funding was announced after I decided to spread LaSalleMart&#39;s technology wings into WordPress. This funding announcement, to me, makes my getting LaSalleMart into WordPress even more compelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>----</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.phparch.com/magazine/2013-2/november/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"November 2013 issue PHP Architect Magazine\">November of PHP Architect magazine</a>&nbsp;profiles the Laravel Framework:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Laravel framework has quickly mobilized a large and active following. It has invigorated the PHP community by doing so many things right. With a shallow learning curve and its ability to simply get out of the way, it allows developers to focus on functionality and business requirements rather than having to worry about setup and basic application infrastructure. In&nbsp;this article, we will take a closer look at what makes Laravel feel so modern, lightweight, and powerful...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before every programming language started sporting several capable frameworks, creating your own framework was almost a rite of passage for web developers. I remember my own patchwork of reusable scripts and classes. It had grown over time, only to be abandoned in favor or Zend, Cake, and Symfony. All of these offered more functionality than my own framework and had active communities to boot. These days, it takes a lot of guts and vision to start your own web development framework, but that&rsquo;s exactly what Taylor Otwell did when he created Laravel, a modern PHP framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel&rsquo;s version 1 was released in June of 2011, but that was only the beginning. Version 2 came out in November of the same year, only to be replaced by version 3 just three months later. Version 4 was another significant rewrite and came out in May of 2013. In a little more than two years and twice as many major releases, Laravel has created a lot of excitement and garnered a dedicated following among PHP developers. It has even spawned its own conference, Laracon. To put this into perspective, take a (very unscientific) look at Figure 1 to see how Google ranks keyword searches for Laravel relative to some of the more popular PHP frameworks. As you can see, interest in Laravel has been increasing steadily and looks poised to overtake the other<br />\r\nframeworks in due time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many welcomed the breakneck speed at which Laravel was evolving, there was a tendency for changes to break compatibility<br />\r\nbetween versions of Laravel, which resulted in some complaints from the growing number of adopters... Not every project has the resources to keep up with framework upgrades. Being locked into a legacy version of a framework can be big deal as the community and support dry up. In response, Taylor Otwell slowed down the development somewhat and committed to a pre-determined release schedule for the upcoming point versions, releasing versions 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 every six months after the 4.0 release.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In his blog, the founder, Taylor Otwell,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://taylorotwell.com/looking-forward-laravel-4-2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LOOKING FORWARD: LARAVEL 4.2\">says</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think any sweeping architecture changes will be needed for a long time (years).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that takes care of that worry!

(27, 32, 3, 'Lasallemart30', '<p>Welcome to my June 2014 &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast, episode number thirty. Wow, thirty podcasts dedicated to updating you on my LaSalleMart ecommerce technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of each month I update you on LaSalleMart; and, on my other projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This transcript is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;the full e-broadcast this month!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two reasons I compose my podcasts beforehand: one, because I stink at ad-libbing; and, two, for SEO juice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Composing this month&#39;s podcast has, again, reminded me that in some way, composing the entire podcast beforehand has serious downsides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, the podcast is a sound medium, and writing everything down first tends to lessen the sound. Basically, it sounds like I am reading, and that is, admittedly, not an attractive thing to hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, I cannot capture everything I want to say in the manner in which I want to say it. My own conclusion of the best podcasting - quote unquote - &nbsp;sound is the &quot;conversation&quot;. You know what I despise about morning radio? The fake ersatz conversational tone the announcers assume with the listener. Their phony attempt to connect emotionally with their listeners. That&#39;s why all the advertisements for morning radio is how fun and friendly these announcers are. Of course, they are connecting to a mass audience, and the words &quot;intimate&quot; and &quot;mass&quot; don&#39;t go together. It&#39;s such a farce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, you and me, we have a real connection. Some of you actually do know me! Some of you have met me. Some of you have at least talked to me on the phone. Everyone else, though, has an interest in what I am up to. The topics matter. I am not a professional morning radio announcer hustling phoney personal bonds with my audience to boost my annual bonus. I am an ecommerce consultant, and a pretty good one at that, and a software developer. And you know something, I don&#39;t make the most of it. And you know why? Because I am a not a professional podcaster!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is the charm, and the curse too. Putting this podcast together, I just got too frustrated trying to put everything into words. And that frustration is going to come out in my voice when I read it out loud to you. On the other hand, I am not a pro. I pause way too much, I say &quot;uh uh uh&quot; all the time, and I cannot moderate my irritating little laugh that drives people crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, I want to share with you my weird and wacky experience I&#39;ve had with Joomla these last two months. I want to share with you my insights about moving to WordPress. I want to share with you my crash course in the Laravel Framework, including my experience at my first Laravel Toronto workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing it all down beforehand is hard, in part because my mind goes on tangents. If I could express those tangents when I record my podcast, whether they are written down or not, then my podcast would be that much more interesting. Even when I write little notes to go on tangents, when I am recording I cannot always get that tangent going. Hey, what was that idea, exactly?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&#39;s a deep dark secret to why I stink at ad-libbing while recording my podcasts. There&#39;s a deep dark secret to why my written scripts get all tangled up. There&#39;s a deep dark secret why I find putting these podcasts together so frustrating,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That deep dark secret is called: getting sued. Secondarily, the deep dark secret is called: pissing people off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deep deep deep deep deep dark secret is that people are insanely sensitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not doing these podcasts to get sued for libel (or whatever). I am not doing these podcasts to get people angry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is particularly difficult with this podcast is the fact that I know that it is so easy to be perceived as having &quot;sour grapes&quot; about Joomla. Yeah, I know... here&#39;s a guy who is unhappy and just complaining like a sore loser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I almost always do is censor myself. I either avoid topics (and avoid &#39;em I do); or, I use neutral inoffensive terminology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, and it happens all the time -- all the time! -- that I spend significant time writing really juicy stuff that I know is going to piss someone off. Oh, to get this stuff indexed in Google, my friends! But, invariably, I rewrite it. And then rewrite it. Then rewrite it again, until I pound the reason for it being so interesting in the first place into dust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You won&#39;t believe the effort these podcasts take me! Last month I did three full rewrites, and over 20 takes. For once I had a real reason, though: the day I recorded my podcast, WordPress announced $160 million in series &quot;C&quot; funding. I extemporized my podcast in order to talk about this very significant event that was directly related to what I had prepared -- but in so doing had completely botched my podcast. But, I noticed that I was expending, even for me, an inordinate effort censoring my script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month, my usual self-censorship produced an unusuhttp://shows.southlasallemedia.com/lasallemart/lasallemart29.mp3al, but perfectly logical, outcome: the podcast does not make sense without the stuff that I know is going to piss people off. Leaving out all the interesting stuff that led to what is a major life changing decision renders the entire podcast void of context. The prose that survived my self-censorship made no sense. Instead of weaving through a tale in a compelling intimate conversational tone, I end up flitting from one independent topic to another independent topic. To be brutally honest, the outcome seems to be to perpetuate my podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not podcasting to podcast. It&#39;s purpose is to provide you with info and insights of my projects and professional life as a way of marketing myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, this month, the rubber meets the road. Either my podcasts are itself the end; or, I get back to basics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My goal is not to piss people off. My goal is not to offend. But, in the end, to tell you the truth, I am getting incredibly offended by being so sensitive to other peoples&#39; sensitivities. In fact, I am overly sensitive to other peoples&#39; sensitivities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not going to now over-compensate by purposely seeking to offend. I am going to offend simply by stating facts. Those facts hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a fact that the Joomla project officially announced its abandonment of its Long Term Support policy without simultaneously announcing its&nbsp;official versioning policy to replace it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not what the Joomla project did in the end that sunk it with me. It&#39;s what it did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;do that did it in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I believed my own lyin&#39; eyes, I needed to make sure that I did not, somehow, miss something. This is why we have local Joomla groups, right? I can go to my monthly Joomla group meet-up, actually talk to knowledge-able Joomla professionals face-to-face, and get the &quot;real deal&quot; on things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, yes, I made a point of attending my local Joomla group meet-up in April. Knowing that the leader of our local Joomla group would be there, I made an especial point of attending -- not necessarily an insignificant thing given I have other volunteership commitments and other things going on in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opening presentation was devoted to the change in versioning policy. After the official workshop, there was the shmoozing meet-up, which yielded bountiful information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, maybe I&#39;ll sound like I am full of sour grapes, and maybe I am at that, or maybe it has nothing to do with &quot;sour grapes&quot;. But, I did my due diligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, I sit beside &quot;the regulars&quot; at these Joomla Toronto meet-ups. Why? Because I&#39;m a regular too. I get there a touch early usually, chat up the gang, and then we sit together. At April&#39;s meet-up, I wanted to see everyone&#39;s body language so I sat away from the regulars. It is the regulars who are most in the know, and I needed to know what they really thought of what was going on. Well, their body language was pretty clear, which was consistent with their&nbsp;confusion. No, there was no policy white paper or blog post or something that enunciated the new versioning policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Joomla project really did abandon their LTS policy without simultaneously enunciating its replacement. Was the new policy argued, after the official policy was abandoned, in the Google Group? Why, yes it was. Do you know what that did to my morale?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, after spending months and months developing, from scratch, an innovative Joomla ecommerce technology based on the superb Akeeba Framework for Joomla, and based on Joomla 3.2, to be used on the upcoming Joomla 3.5 LTS, I see that the LTS is dropped, with no official announcement of its release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you understand what it really took to get LaSalleMart 3.0 going? Do you understand what an incredible commitment it was to Joomla 3.5 LTS? What reaction do you think I&#39;m going to have when an explicitly termed &quot;Long Term&quot; version policy is abandoned, to be replaced with -- oh, there is no official replacement version policy? Do you think that my family is disinterested what I do? Do &nbsp;you think that I am all alone here in Toronto with nothing better to do than to program gorgeous new innovative Joomla ecommerce technology for kicks? Do you think that I&#39;m not taking the absolute best care I possibly can in creating it? Do you know the investment in learning LaSalleMart 3.0 represents? Do you know the nights I&#39;ve spent figuring out how I should use FOFv2 with Joomla v3.2?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, I did not even realize that the Joomla 3.5 LTS version was even in jeopardy. Did a missive come through to the local Joomla Groups for feedback? Was there an article or something about it? What did I miss? Am I not on email lists? How is it that being on the exec of my local Joomla Group, that no one had brought it to my attention that the LTS version was &quot;on the table&quot;? Furthermore, how would such a thing not be mentioned in the FOF project, where I am on not one, but two lists? Am I not following a zillion Joomla people on Twitter? You know, just writing this down is pissing me off! How could something this major in Joomla, that so intimately affects me, have side-swiped me? This is why my my number one question at last April&#39;s Toronto Joomla group meet-up was &quot;what did I miss?&quot;. Well, I missed nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I state again that the Joomla version policy explicitly stated the words &quot;Long Term&quot;. The policy was an explicit long term policy. It was this long term versioning policy, in effect for years, mimicking the ubuntu policy, that assured me that my family&#39;s very significant investment in LaSalleMart 3.0 would achieve the Return on Investment we expected of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, with all that, if the new versioning policy was changed to accommodate new pressures, yet preserved the long term nature of the &quot;LTS&quot; policy it was replacing -- or, had a variant -- then all would be fine, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, there was no new versioning policy. For about two weeks. So what do you think is going to happen here? I&#39;m going to panic. And that&#39;s exactly what I did: I panicked. Where there was clear expanse of sky was replaced by looking straight into the abyss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My confidence in the Joomla project evaporated right then and there, and nothing in the almost two months hence has restored any confidence. In retrospect, and what I did not realize before, is that my confidence in the Joomla project took a hit already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I saw it, the only way to realize a return with LaSalleMart was to change base technologies. The probabilities had changed. And so much so, that staying in Joomla was more risk than leaving it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The versioning strategy vaccuum existed for two weeks. Then, two articles were published on the Joomla website. They were dense with text and badly formatted. Again, to tell you the truth, my eyes glazed over. I saw they made a reference to the WordPress version policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y&#39;know, does WordPress mention Joomla in their official policy edicts? &quot;We have a great version strategy because it is just like Joomla&#39;s&quot;. Oh, another one: &quot;We have a great feature set because it is so much like Joomla!&quot;. Oh, no, I am lying. WordPress does nothing of the sort. WordPress&#39; version strategy is that the newest release is &quot;THE&quot; release. That&#39;s it. There&#39;s only one up-to-date release and that is whatever the latest release is. And that release will not break the previous release. That&#39;s it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla&#39;s version policy mimicks ubuntu. Ubuntu is the most widely distributed version of Linux. Ubuntu is crystal clear what its versioning policy is. It has a nice chart. It is crystal clear, powerfully brief, statement on its recently released long term version 14.04: we will support this version for five years. That&#39;s not a typo, it really is five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually do not think Joomla is mis-managed. What I think is going on is that this is what Joomla is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Joomla is, how I see it... Joomla is an open source project where individuals, or individuals banding together, vie for control. Not one single person or group has absolute control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code manifests this -- to quote WordPress, just for irony&#39;s sake -- like poetry in code. And I&#39;ve accepted this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project&#39;s management manifests this. I always thought that this was inherently good because the technology changes, and so Joomla had a way of translating the pressures of a changing technological world into the project. Now, the way I see it is that I am wrong. All that happens is that the office politics morph into the project and into the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it was not -- repeat not -- mis-management that caused this versioning stuff to happen. That&#39;s just how Joomla is. The person or group that prevailed made the abandonment announcement. The person or group that prevailed -- or perhaps that did not prevail -- prevented a new policy from being simultaneously announced. Basically, it&#39;s just office politics. For whomever, it was critical to slay the existing versioning policy in order to pave the way for whatever was to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, you do not kill an explicitly stated &quot;Long Term&quot; versioning policy to replace it with a long term versioning policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, I very much wanted to salvage LaSalleMart 3.0. Weeks away from its first release, I really really wanted to release it and get some ROI from it. So, I went searching for after-the-fact justification to continue developing it. And I am going to tell you that I was, and still am, shocked at the affirmation of my decision to leave Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I harp on the market share statistics because I had no idea that Joomla&#39;s market share was abysmal. In 2007 I saw Joomla as the coming thing. It was the coming thing, and was number one. But I had no idea that since 2012, it&#39;s share was plummeting. WordPress was taking it&#39;s share away and running away with the CMS market. Although I felt the market share decline, I did not realize how bad it was. WordPress has 60% of the CMS market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the day I recorded my April podcast, WordPress announced $160 million in series &quot;C&quot; venture funding. I knew they had &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; funding but is was in 2008! Time flies, eh! I read the articles, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me one bit if WordPress had 70% in 12 to 18 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All remaining CMS in the entire world have 40% of the CMS market. That&#39;s going down to 30%, of that I am sure. Of all the remaining CMS&#39;s, Joomla is #1, with 8.4% of the entire CMS market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah, but Joomla is really three separate CMS&#39;s, not one. There&#39;s Joomla 1.0 and 1.5, with half of all Joomla sites. Yes, half! There&#39;s Joomla 2.5 LTS, with 40% of all Joomla installs. Then there&#39;s Joomla 3.x series, with 10% of all Joomla installs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means that Joomla 1.0/1.5 is actually #2 in market share behind WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means that Joomla 2.5 is actually #3 in market share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means that Joomla 3.0 shares the bronze medal in market share with a lot of other CMS&#39;s you forgot about or never heard of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla 1.0 and 1.5 represent the days when Joomla was the number one CMS in the world. Those days are long gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla 2.5 represents the Joomla at its absolute peak, when WordPress equalled Joomla&#39;s market share. Joomla 2.5&#39;s end-of-life is slated officially this coming December. Who is going to build a new site in Joomla 2.5 at this stage of the game?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla&#39;s fate rests with version 3. Just to maintain Joomla&#39;s overall market share, one new Joomla 3 has to be built for every Joomla 1.0, 1.5, and 2.5 that is attritioned out. I myself have three Joomla client sites that are moving to WordPress by year-end. Plus, my own LaSalleMart.com will likely not be in Joomla. So, that&#39;s four new Joomla 3 sites that need to go live just so Joomla can maintain its overall market share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, Joomla 3.0 needs explosive growth to grow its market share. There are very few CMS from which it can take that share from. So, either it grows the CMS pie, or it takes it away from WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only after my &quot;abyss&quot; moment with Joomla did I see the market share numbers -- I was not paying attention, eh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, WordPress announced their new funding. WordPress did pretty well with their $7 million funding, so I figure they just might do ok with their new $160 million funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, there are new kids on the CMS block. It&#39;s nascent, it&#39;s under-the-radar. It hasn&#39;t hit it&#39;s stride, but it will. How much of a niche will Laravel based CMS get? There are barriers to installing a Laravel CMS on a shared host, but I think what we may be seeing is something new. That will entail another podcast, but it is not without significance that one of the three topics at the recent Laravel Toronto meet-up was &quot;deployment&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem for Joomla is that any new entrant to the CMS market that gets any traction, will take it from Joomla. No one is going to challenge WordPress -- there is only the remaining 30% to 40% to take it from, and Joomla is the only significant player to take market share from. Yes, there is Drupal, but Drupal has set themselves beautifully as a niche player, so they will hold their own. Drupal is a red herring anyways, it is Joomla that is most vulnerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla&#39;s CMS market share is either going to fall, or it is going to rise. The other CMS&#39; market share are so marginal that it doesn&#39;t matter statistically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress does not have the attrition risk that Joomla does. In fact, WordPress now has automatic updates (which I hate), and 97% of all WordPress updates occurred via auto-updating (yes, I am now part of the 3%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reality is that Joomla is in a turn-around scenario. It is in a long term secular market share decline. If it does not stop it&#39;s decline, then it will keep declining. &nbsp;If Joomla does not turn around, it will keep going in the direction that it is going. And that direction is down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check the stats for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am kicking myself for being so invested in Joomla that I did not see the raw market share reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although, I did see Joomla 3.5 shaping up to be a really really good ecommerce platform, essentially due&nbsp;of the inclusion of the Akeeba Framework for Joomla in Joomla that started in Joomla 3.2. This framework really made LaSalleMart 3.0 tick. Things were cooking!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was pretty shaken by the author of this superb framework refusing its inclusion into future Joomla versions. Abandoning the long term version with no new version policy announced at the same time, which happened after the Akeeba Framework announcement, was too much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am sure that someone in the Joomla-verse is going to be offended. Well, too bad. What happened really happened, and that&#39;s my analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to leave no lose ends here, my interest in the Joomla Framework has dropped to zero. If anything, my crash course in Laravel has increased my understanding of the Joomla Framework. This understanding does not attract me to the Joomla Framework, nor lead me back to Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is something that just came out in beta, called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://octobercms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"October CMS, a Laravel based Content System\">October CMS</a>. From its home page:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. It allows developers to have full self-expression and the freedom to build web applications however they want.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I like that they say &quot;developers&quot; and not &quot;users&quot;. I&#39;ve not gone through the code, but I am intrigued. Laravel as a community, the way I see it, has hit an inflection point, of which I am a part. The OctoberCMS project is but one of a growing number of Laravel based projects. Laravel is itself an upstart, now four years old and maturing. On this momentum, if any Laravel based CMS gains traction, it will eat into Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla has a CMS, and it has a PHP Framework. Yet, it did not lead the way with a CMS based on its framework, leaving this intiative to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I never wanted to create an ecommerce technology as a WordPress plugin, and I still do not want to do so. WordPress&#39; codebase is long on the tooth. On the other hand, Laravel is a PHP Framework focused on creating web applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel is an upstart. Four years ago its founder had a vision and went for it. Four years hence, it has matured and has gained enormous acceptance within the PHP community. It is very modern. Laravel underwent enormous changes in the first versions. Only now, in its version 4 series has it settled down. It is pretty clear that the community told the Laravel founder that he stabilize the code or the community will reject Laravel. That was version 3, if my history is correct. Version 4 represented the last technology leaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Laravel is concerning itself with, the way I see it, adoption. Laravel&#39;s founder is launching little businesses, such as the Forge for deployment. I applaud him for releasing Cashier, a subscription ecommerce app he developed for himself. I will be studying this code too. Now that Laravel is here to stay, has matured, has stabilized, and has achieved an inflection point of adoption, the Laravel community is starting to crank out the apps. Again, this is how I see it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am well on my way to proficiency with Laravel. Once I downloaded it, messed up the install, and became totally confused, I decided to pretend I was taking a college course. I started reading up on the framework, its architecture, the approach it requires. Laravel demands that it be approached in a certain way in order to make the most of it. Learning this approach is not a trivial effort, but it is enormously satisfying. I am finally learning to program proper web applications. Not just put together websites. Not just integrating extensions or plugins. Not programming extensions. But, actual web applications using a modern PHP framework. It is enormously satisfying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel opens new opportunities. I suspect that these opportunities will avail to clients who have more of a start-up mentality than just a &quot;build me a website&quot; mentality, if my experience at my first&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2014/2014-may-22-laravel-toronto-workshop\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2014 May 22 Laravel Toronto Workshop\">Laravel Toronto meet-up</a>&nbsp;is any indication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a few weeks, I will be at the point where I can plan out LaSalleMart 4.0 with Laravel. Having the product front-end reside in WordPress as a WordPress post is an attractive proposition, initial LaSalleMart 4.0 development will ignore WordPress. My initial inclination was LaSalleMart 4.0 touch WordPress, but in the short term, LaSalleMart 4.0 needs to come into existence first. Then, we can talk WordPress integration - for which I have a few idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something that I&#39;ve had on my mind for a while is LaSalleCast and reviving my &quot;The Bob Bloom Show&quot; podcast. Once I have LaSalleMart 4.0 going, I want to get LaSalleCast off the ground. LaSalleCast is my rendition of an e-broadcast platform, which, as you&#39;ve guessed by now, I want to do with Laravel. WordPress has serious strategic strengths for blogging and e-broadcasting, so I may do some serious integration right off the bat. On the other hand, there is a chance that I will not integrate right away. It depends, and I&#39;ll have to deep dive into this in the fall on another podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCast is something that I am developing for myself, yet will be something I will offer clients. LaSalleMart is something I am developing for clients, but will be so powerful that -- I kid you not -- I am already searching for an e-business or e-businesses to run on it. That is how kick-ass I know LaSalleMart 4.0 will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need workflow for my podcasting -- it is sorely missing. As well, I need some type of scheduling and advertisement management. So, the first main emphasis of LaSalleCast is back office functionality. So, WordPress may be the face of my podcasting, with the back office in Laravel. We&#39;ll see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is overlap between LaSalleMart and LaSalleCast, such as the email notification. It&#39;s too early at this point to say for sure, but what will likely happen is that I will create packages for certain function so that both can use them. As well, these packages will be available to clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something that I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long while is converge e-commerce with e-broadcast. Finally, this vision is in sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if it seems like I&#39;m happy, well, I am happy. I am very much at home with WordPress. And I am starting to really take to Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am in the early stages of working with a consultant I&#39;ve worked with for many many years on WordPress plugins. In June, I will start working on tax plugins for WooCommerce for California, Canada, Florida, and North Carolina. Based on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2013/woocommerce-florida-tax-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Just Wrote a WooCommerce Tax Plugin\">my existing WooCommerce tax plugin</a>, which needs sprucing up for general distribution. Yes, I&#39;ve already written a WooCommerce tax plugin!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are discussing other WooCommerce plugins. It&#39;s just too nascent right now to announce anything. Suffice to say that I am&nbsp;not gliding into WordPress; rather, I am diving into the deep end of WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My ecommerce specialties and business plans are settling down beautifully now. It just feels right. I do not know quite how to describe it, but it just feels right in a way that it did not quite feel before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want a few more weeks to focus on getting my new projects off the ground; then, I want to update my LaSalleMart dot com site to be my consulting site. I do not have a decent site for marketing, which is crazy but reflects the lack of stasis&nbsp;I was feeling. Now, it feels right, the projects are right, the focus is right. It&#39;s coming together now. And I want LaSalleMart dot com to reflect that and to attract new clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SouthLaSalle dot com will be my blogging site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SouthLaSalleMedia dot com will remain as my media site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCast dot com may end up a live site in the fall -- we&#39;ll see!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to track all these projects, we are using Atlassian.com. It&#39;s not the prettiest project management and software development site, but it is my site of choice. For the first time, I am using Atlassian in a team setting. My Atlassian skills are already increasing as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check my blog for in-month updates. I&#39;ve made the mistake of not posting updates to my blog for long stretches of time, and I will not be making the same mistake again. Get my new blog posts in your email by subscribing to my Feedburner email at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=SouthlasalleCommerceBlog&amp;loc=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SouthLaSalle Blog RSS to email service by Feedburner\">http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=SouthlasalleCommerceBlog&amp;loc=en_US</a>.

(28, 33, 3, 'Lasallemart31', '<p>Welcome to my July 2014 &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast, episode number thirty-one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of each month I update you on LaSalleMart; and, on my other projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big thank you to all in the Laravel community who provide an abundance of educational materials and source code. The May Laracon 2014 NYC videos recently released are very helpful -- although the lightening talk was surprisingly about lightening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fabulous Laracasts tutorial videos, well worth the $9/month, are called &quot;The Netflix for Developers&quot;. Well, for me, the Netflix marketing line is more apropos for me this month, as &quot;I need to get it, to get it&quot;. In order to understand the tutorials, and the other articles and videos, I have to understand Laravel first. But, to understand the Laravel Framework, I need to wade through the learning, along with my own prototyping; and, after re-doing my LaSalleMart site with Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magic moment happened over the weekend, ironically, from learning how to destroy a piece of Laravel. One of the Laracon 2014 NYC videos, entitled &quot;Break the Mold&quot;, advices to destroy the bulk of the &quot;app&quot; folder, and in its place create a custom &quot;src&quot; folder. Don&#39;t really know why this was the &quot;aha!&quot; moment, but it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since that &quot;aha!&quot; moment, I started going through the learning materials again. Now that I get it, I can get it! There is a lot to get, but after two months, Laravel is starting to fall into place. I figure it&#39;ll be a few more months before Laravel really falls into place, but progress is progress! On deck is diving into the &quot;command bus&quot;, which another Laracon 2014 NYC session talks about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Laracast videos on this topic both intrigued me and frustrated me. The concept of events is very attractive -- I can see events having a huge role in LaSalleMart 4. But diving into the code and jargon lost me. Jargon in particular is tricky, because I already have my own idea what &quot;events&quot; mean. But do I understand the Laravel use of the word &quot;events&quot;? No. So, I end up stopping the video frequently to stare at the code and try to have the ideas sink in. What I really end up achieving is getting a disjointed sense of the tutorial due to my stoppages. So, I have to return to those video tutorials on Laracasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also want to thank the not-even-a-year-old Toronto Laravel group for hosting their summer workshop series, which I am looking forward to. I already have a list of questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am currently contemplating starting up my pet project in Laravel before diving into LaSalleMart 4.0 development. My e-broadcast project is a smaller project than my LaSalleMart ecommerce project. So, to get a better handle on Laravel, why not start on LaSalleCast first?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, the reason why it&#39;s a stupid idea is because LaSalleCast is going to lie fallow for a while. Except for the fact that I am seriously considering re-starting my &quot;The Bob Bloom Show&quot; podcasts in the fall, and to make it happen I need an e-broadcast platform. In particular, I need a workflow where I can plan out shows, have somewhere where I can make notes, publish show notes &amp; transcripts, send emails confirming shows &amp; reminders -- would really like to have emails sent/received and stored in a CRM-ish type thing. There&#39;s a whole bunch of creature features I want to support my podcasting, including features to support sponsorship. Yeah,, this is supposed to be my nice little introductory Laravel project! Well, for an interview podcast, it took me easily four to six hours from contacting potential interviewees to final podcast publishing for each show. It&#39;s too much, especially if I&#39;m to build out my podcast offerings. Hence, LaSalleCast. Nothing is definite, but I am seriously considering starting my pet LaSalleCast project first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A funny thing happened on the way to publishing some blog posts: they became the basis for this month&#39;s podcast. I am not necessarily going to read verbatim these blog posts, but they are certainly the basis for this month&#39;s podcast:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2014/my-opinion-of-wordpress-has-not-changed-through-the-years\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"My Opinion of WordPress is Unchanged\">My Opinion of WordPress Has Not Changed Through the Years</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2014/music-to-my-ears-stick-with-laravel-4-for-while\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Music to my Ears: &quot;Going to Stick with Laravel 4.x For A While\">Music to my Ears: &quot;Going to Stick with Laravel 4.x For A While</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.southlasalle.com/2014/lasallemart-4-approach-part-deux\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LaSalleMart 4 Approach, part Deux\">LaSalleMart 4 Approach, part Deux</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially &quot;Part Deux&quot;, as there became a point where I knew it would become my podcast, so I started messing around with the article for this podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, wishing you a profitable month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

Almost every question I have is addressed somewhere in cyber-space. Not all, but close!

There is much that has transpired, and much that I want to discuss with you, as my long and varied notes for this broadcast indicated. I want to keep this podcast focused on my projects, and not on more general projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was supposed to have at the end of my break my custom e-broadcasting web application; and, to have moved this Media site, to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two significant things happened that got in the way: deep refactoring of the base software that my e-broadcasting software would burst from; and, I got levelled with the flu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MY PLANS FOR 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, here we are at the top of the New Year 2015. What are my plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My plans are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* develop my software trio:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>** LaSalleCMS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>** LaSalleMart</p>\r\n\r\n<p>** LaSalleCast</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* develop LaSalleCast for my own Media site, using it to build my e-broadcasting into a line of business</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* add to my Family of Clients</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* run ecommerce sites directly using my own software</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, what I wanted to do in 2014, I will persist with in 2015. &nbsp;Develop software for client use; and, to build up my own lines of businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is absolutely crazy about my plans is that I will develop not one, not two, but three seriously major pieces of software. Each one alone is worthy of dedicating 2015 to its care and feeding. What is downright nutty is that two of the three will be developed from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LASALLECMS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalle Content Management System is my blogging web application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Version one is done and available on GitHub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is free open sourced software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I do want to offer LaSalleCast</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LASALLECAST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCast is my e-broadcasting web application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed specifically for me to build up my e-broadcasting as a line of business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will not be distributed as free open sourced software; and, probably will not be available for sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCast will be available to my Family of Clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LASALLEMART</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart is my ecommerce web application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are more ecommerce offerings out there than ever before, I still see a need to have my own offering. In fact, as much as ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHY BRINGING MY SOFTWARE TRIO TO FRUITION WILL WORK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Related Software Built &nbsp;as Installable Packages</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I really need to build a separate Contact Me form for each software? Of course not. I extracted out LaSalleCMS&#39; contact form into a separate installable package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is the starting point for LaSalleCast and LaSalleMart. So much so that I re-wrote big chunks of it as installable packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I say that I&#39;ll have three big software programs, in reality I&#39;ll have a myriad of small-ish software programs that can be mixed and matched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For custom administrative (and front-end too) forms, I want to find third party tools that speed up development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Not one, not two, but three previous LaSalleMart versions for Joomla</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 was a special version. Privately, I consider LM3 the best Joomla software never to be released. Built from scratch, I really like how it turned out. A lot went into something that no one ever saw. Screenshots are on LaSalleMart Dot Com, but it scratches the surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LaSalleMart I&#39;ll be building is really LM4. There is a body of work to draw on, and draw on I have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* API</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each software will have its own Application Programming Interface, or API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each API will start off as an Internal API, for use within the app itself. No outside requests will be accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think of it this way: the processing will occur in a segregated part of the software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this is what I really want to achieve right now anyways. I want the processing to be separate from what you see in the app. The processing must be separate from the front-end (what the public sees), and from the administrative back-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code that processes the form must not be embedded in the form code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not having built an API before, I will keep things manageable by building them as internal API&#39;s first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The funny thing about building an API is that, well, there&#39;s no web page to see what&#39;s going on. So it becomes imperative to test it. Testing is so important that it frames how to approach building the software. The outcome is better organized and tested software. It will be the first time I build software like this. After much studying and doing dry-run exercises, I am looking forward to doing it for real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With LaSalleMart, I am building the API first. So, I am going to end up with an ecommerce app that no one can see because there is no form or web page associated with it. There is no cart page, but you can add to the cart! There is no checkout to click to, but you can process your order!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My apps will have three main elements: a front-end (that we traditionally think of as &quot;the website&quot;), a back-end; and, an API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I get a handle on the LaSalleMart API, I will introduce an API into LaSalleCMS. Then, with LaSalleCast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, I talk about developing three distinct apps. Yet, the reality is that there will be a lot of installable packages that together will comprise the app.&nbsp;However, it is possible -- nay, likely -- that I&#39;ll have packages that themselves are just internal API&#39;s. For example, I want to build an email send/receive facility for LaSalleCast. I may end up building a mini-app just for this feature, with one package being just the API; and, a package being a base administrative GUI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Tight Scope</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ha, I have no intention of keeping scope tight at all!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I plan on building a lot of software packages. Each package will have limited scope. But, I plan on having a lot of installable packages!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not feel the pressure to build every little ecommerce creature-feature into LaSalleMart right away. We&#39;ll get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LARAVEL AND SOFTWARE UPDATES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla version changes obsoleted LaSalleMart. That&#39;s how three LaSalleMart versions in Joomla happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This business of throwing away software is very bad for business. Very bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is based on the Laravel Framework version 4.2. There is a new version of Laravel, v5, on the way, and for the time being, I am ignoring it. I have no intention of upgrading any software I&#39;ve built to L5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When L5 comes out, I&#39;ll take a look at it. If the Value Proposition is there to use it, or parts of it, then I will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not making any effort to learn L5 ahead of its release. I&#39;ve already wasted a good two weeks working ahead, back when the version was to be version 4.3. The transition to v4.3 was actually quite fabulous, and then not so fabulous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there&#39;s one resolution I have this New Years, it&#39;s not to have version changes in underlying software that I use bring my business to a grinding halt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have big time rants on this subject that I want to avoid getting into, so I&#39;m going to keep it minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel is based on the Symfony Framework. I have read up on Symfony documentation, poked at the source code, and in general paid a lot more attention to Symfony than I have when I first started with Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At last November&#39;s True North PHP Conference here in Toronto, there was a presentation about using PHP interfaces as a way to not fuse one&#39;s packages to Laravel. I find this approach quite fascinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MY AGE IS AFFECTING MY ATTITUDE TO MY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am now firmly on the other side of fifty. This fall, I could feel my age affecting my attitude about my software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know what software I want to develop. I know what Family of Clients I want. I just know. I want to&nbsp;Make It Happen now and bring in the Ka-Ching!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am introducing a topic that demands its own podcast, but will give it short thrift here. I just want to alert you that I noticed something different in my attitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is my humble opinion that a lot of the advice that I come across really does not pertain to me at all. Further, a lot of the advice that I&#39;ve come across in the PHP framework realm is really promotion, with people looking to make a name for themselves. It&#39;s not different from anything else I&#39;ve experience elsewhere, but I&#39;ve just lot patience with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I had LaSalleCMS version one done, I started extracting chunks of it into installable packages. Once I was deep into this set of re-writes, I started concluding that a lot of what I was doing, due to accepting the wise counsel of others, frequently decades my junior, was either not carved-in-stone as I thought, or was just bullshit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My age is, in a significant way, pressuring me to make my efforts pay off. I do not consider myself having all sorts of time to make up for foul-ups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I have concluded that I do need to persist with my software. However, when building my software, keep it simple. Make it as human readable as possible. Do not over-engineer it. Sometimes, 10 lines of human readable code done simply is better than 3 lines of clever code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TIMELINES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When will my apps be ready? I don&#39;t know, and, furthermore, I am not going to worry about it. More importantly is that I plug away. I figure once I have my base LaSalleMart internal API done; and, my re-written LaSalleCMS with its own internal API done, I will be at a good point to grow my Family of Clients. At this point, as well, I will build out a LaSalleMart administrative back-end; and, have a wish-list of features I want to do for LaSalleCMS. It will be important just to go heads-down and Make It Happen, then to fret about timelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, We Plan and God Laughs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, wishing you a profitable month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

The fourth version is being built from scratch with the Laravel Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my own custom content web application, built with Laravel. My sites, except for this Media site, runs on LaSalleCMS. This content system of mine is about to undergo a major re-write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCast is my e-broadcast web application, built with Laravel, for the express purpose of running this Media site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>January Activity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>January was a productive month. Just not so much for my Software Trio&#39;s development. My volunteer work intensified this month at the cost of doing some serious dev work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, this month, I decided two things about LaSalleMart&#39;s development:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i) the LaSalleMart API will be a true API, and not just an &quot;internal&quot; API</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii) the LaSalleMart API will be released as Free Open Source Software (FOSS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, this triggered an unexpected journey into API tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the brink of commencing my ambitious 2015 development for my Software Trio, I am clearing the path by catching up on my blog entries, wrapping up the last of my clump of volunteer work; and, publishing this podcast a week early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Excited About Laravel 5</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am excited about Laravel all over again. Maybe the best thing to come out of this month was my discovery that annotations in Laravel 5 is delegated to a separate package. This discovery whet my appetite to learn what else has been going on with the new Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, I was not happy about the direction Laravel development was taking in October. So unhappy that I concluded that my best course of action was to continue using Laravel 4.2 for all my development. I stopped following Laravel 5&#39;s development -- I ignored all the Laracast videos on L5, I unwatched Laravel&#39;s GitHub, I stopped reading blog posts about L5. &nbsp;I did check the official Laravel blog, which updated last around U.S. Thanksgiving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, Laravel 5 is ending up sounding very very good. I listened to the latest Laravel podcasts, read some blog posts, and I will absolutely be using L5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>FOSS&#39;ing LaSalleCMS and LaSalleMart API</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing is the only reason I decided that LaSalleMart&#39;s API will be FOSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very important that I be seen as an expert. I certainly was seen as a Joomla ecommerce expert. But now? Now I have to build that up again with Laravel. And what better way to do so than for people to see that I have created Laravel based ecommerce software?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, how will people really know that I have real ecommerce software if they can&#39;t see it. This was a problem with my previous three LaSalleMart versions (all Joomla add-ons), which caused me to waffle on releasing a crimped free version. The real reason I waffled about releasing a crimped free version was worrying about support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I call it LaSalleMart 4 so you know I have three other versions of it. But, I&#39;ll end up calling it just LaSalleMart, and then releasing it as LaSalleMart 1.0, as if the Joomla versions never happened. Otherwise, I&#39;ll be asked where the other three LaSalleMart versions are. Well, those versions are unusuable... just for Joomla.. and I don&#39;t develop for Joomla anymore. Yeah, not gonna work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not releasing LaSalleMart&#39;s administrative back-end as FOSS. Nor will I release any front-ends either. Excuse the pun, but I&#39;m not giving away the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am planning on giving away the store with LaSalleCMS, my custom content web app, which I pretty much intended from the start. Doing so is still somewhat counter-intuitive to me, and I find I walk around explaining to myself why releasing all my content web app stuff is a Good Thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My conclusion why it is a Good Thing is always the same:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" 	What is the Meaning of The Medium is the Message?\">The Medium Is The Message</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The software, and software development itself, is the marketing. Here&#39;s a Google search result set for you:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.ca/search?q=resumes+lack+github&amp;oq=resumes+lack+github\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Google search results: resumes lack github\">https://www.google.ca/search?q=resumes+lack+github&amp;oq=resumes+lack+github</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attracting contributors is about the last thing on my mind, if you were wondering. Although asking for technical help will be easier since I can link to a real repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Economics of Web Applications is Changing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to sneak this topic into this podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to create a web application, you get yourself $30,000 to $60,000 to start, and you have yourself the makings of a start-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want a website, you download WordPress (usually) or Joomla (less usually) or maybe something else, buy a canned template, and you create the site yourself, or you pay up to $4,000 (ish) for the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of a nice basic site is coming down hard. Or will be. The marketplace is finding WordPress and Joomla unweildy.&nbsp;FOSS projects like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jekyll \">Jekyll</a>&nbsp;reduces the effort to create and maintain a nice little website. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://getgrav.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Grav\">Grav Project</a>&nbsp;is very interesting. I am looking forward to building nice little sites for modest fees with my own LaSalleCMS, something that will be quite feasible after my deep re-write slated for March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a cottage industry of Laravel based packages that is lowering the cost of creating web apps. Which may be overstating things a bit because this cottage industry is still nascent. But growing, and some packages are being recognized as established and actively maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trend has started, if not accelerated enough to manifest quite yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I am on the forefront, moving from Joomla/WordPress to Laravel; and, offering Laravel based FOSS packages myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Crazy Ambitious Software Trio Road Map</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is crazy that I plan on releasing a re-factored LaSalleCMS by the end of March; a new e-broadcast web app for my own Media site this summer; and of course a from-scratch Laravel based ecommerce technology released in gradations over this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each project is worthy of its own start-up (or multi contributor open source project). Yet, I am undertaking them all this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it would be really crazy if I did not have LaSalleMart 3, my Joomla ecommerce add-on that I built from scratch last year for the new Joomla 3. And, it would be crazy if I did not have LaSalleCMS 1.0 under my belt. But I do have LM3; and, I do have LaSalleCMS 1.0. So I&#39;m crazy ambitious, but not doomed-crazy ambitious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart 3 exists, and represents my vision for ecommerce software. All I want to do right now is, basically, recreate LM3 with Laravel. And, do it, basically over the course of 2015 -- preferably sooner than later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes LaSalleMart&#39;s development different from LaSalleCMS and LaSalleCast&#39;s development is that I want to bring in client sponsorship early. Once the API is done, and the bulk of the administrative back-end is done, I want clients to sponsor new features. Of course, this means that I&#39;ll need LaSalleMart clients, but one thing at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS 1.0 is done. My sites, except this Media site, run on it. However, it needs serious re-writing, including its own API. So much overall development depends on LaSalleCMS&#39; development, that in a way this development is priority over LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart&#39;s API may not be done by the end of February, but I&#39;m sure it will have progressed seriously. I plan on stopping LaSalleMart&#39;s development at the end of February so I can dive into LaSalleCMS&#39; re-factoring, using what I&#39;ve learned from LaSalleMart&#39;s API development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, I can complete LaSalleCMS&#39; re-factoring in March, as well as migrate my sites to it. Then, continue in tandem LaSalleMart and LaSalleCast&#39;s development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS and LaSalleCast are expected to be done this year. LaSalleMart is not, which opens up the possibility of actually achieving my Software Trio ambitions this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, with LaSalleCMS 2.0 achieved, with LaSalleMart&#39;s development progessing, and the start of LaSalleCast development, I will add to my family of cilents by the spring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interview at Laravel News</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My recent Laravel News interview is at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://laravel-news.com/2015/01/artisan-files-bob-bloom/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://laravel-news.com/2015/01/artisan-files-bob-bloom\">https://laravel-news.com/2015/01/artisan-files-bob-bloom</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was sent seven questions. I wrote out answers for five of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I demurred on two of the questions because I am not as accomplished as other interviewees. There are no secrets to my success to discover from the developer tools I use; nor, what my typical day looks like. My most likely point of interest is why I moved from Joomla to Laravel. Which is the theme of my interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>I Closed My JIRA and Confluence&nbsp;Subscriptions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>BitBucket I still have. But I find I am not using JIRA, and my Confluence use-age has dropped. Confluence integrates with JIRA and the other Atlassian offerings. Using it just for knowledge base websites is a bit nuts. So, I closed my JIRA and Confluence subscriptions. I&#39;ve had these subscriptions for years, and have blogged about Atlassian (including attending their Toronto Road Show visit twice). So I wanted to make a note here of the change. I&#39;ll be on GitHub more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, wishing you a profitable month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(33, 39, 3, 'Lasallemart36', '<p>Welcome to my April&nbsp;2015&nbsp;edition of the &quot;LaSalleMart News&quot; podcast, episode #36.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleMart News is my monthly podcast, published at the top of each month to update you on my LaSalle Software:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>LaSalle Content Management System,</li>\r\n	<li>LaSalleMart ecommerce,</li>\r\n	<li>LaSalleCast e-broadcasting platform,</li>\r\n	<li>LaSalleCRM customer management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bulk of LaSalleCMS version two is done. Or, what I&#39;ve been telling myself this week: the worst is over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is my blogging app, that also serves as the basis for my other web apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hand crafted with love using the latest Laravel 5 framework, &nbsp;I did it my way, in the way that I envisioned building it. It made the initial effort harder, which makes it all the more satisfying with the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaSalleCMS is comprised of a series of packages that are added on to the main app. Each package is related to each other, and must be installed together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed crazy at first to build up a bunch of separate packages, when it would be easier to create one big package. Or, just forget about packages completely. But, now that the bulk of my blog app is done, it has already been a help doing it this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I built a user management package that is really just a user authentication package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I built an admin package for all the back-end administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I built a utilities package to hold helpful tidbits of code -- which is why I call it my &quot;helper&quot; package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I built a front-end package that right now is just the skeleton package. It&#39;s the last of the major CMS packages I will build out, as the default template will be the actual template I build for my own sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I built a package as my internal API. A first for me, that I separated out the &quot;guts&quot; from the back-end and front-end. Doing so proved to be pivotal to creating a sane differentiation between the packages, which actually made development much better after I got over the hump of setting it all up -- and testing that it would actually work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building these different yet related add-on packages forced me to keep each package strictly within its purpose. The internal API has no visual rendering of a website. The admin package has no database processing. There&#39;s no mish-mash of functions, each package is quite structured for its purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My admin package is successfully using Laravel&#39;s native command bus feature. The &quot;handler&quot; is calling the internal API. The internal API handles form processing in a structured way, with an interface. As it stands, it&#39;s a bit of an overblown set-up for the current mundane tasks. But it&#39;s a terrific base to build on, which is exactly the point. These packages are the basic app plumbing for custom development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am making headway with testing. Relatively speaking, I lavished time on learning testing in March. I have phpunit tests for custom auth rules, which was a learning experience -- least of which was learning to build test-able software. In mid-March a new integration test package from Laracasts was released called Integrated. It is brilliant, and is something I will get into more. Likely, I will set up retro-active integration tests locally with this package. A new addition to it is Selenium, which I always had my eye on to use for tests as it mimics browser actions algorithmically -- the new Integrated package looks like a way to use Selenium painlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lessons about testing that I mentioned in my last podcast I have in mind throughout my development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was originally going to progress linearly through my software and website development. Now, however, I am changing tact a bit. I will wrap up LaSalleCMS v2 development. Instead of updating my own sites with LaSalleCMS v2, I will continue with my &quot;back end&quot; development. Nail down some extras like RSS feed, update my L4 contact and backup packages. Then, I will build the beginnings of my customer management package so I can use this feature for myself. Then, I want to detour and build out a quick project management package -- which will have a back-end only, and be rather basic. Again, something for my own use. All these packages I am listing on GitHub as FOSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, I will build the first phase of LaSalleCast -- again for my own use. It won&#39;t have all the bells and whistles I originally wanted for version one, but it&#39;s better for me to get all this software done first, even if LaSalleCast is absent some features initially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, I will turn my attention to using my software for myself. Meaning, I need to build out the front-ends for my own sites. Given that I need to migrate my podcast site, this build-out will take some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bulk of this effort should be done by the end of May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My sense is that I&#39;ll build out features for my current software in May/June. Such as, a media manager; and, an email manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, I&#39;ll be in a great spot to start work on LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building my LaSalle Software seemed so far off, and so overwhelming. Now, seeing LaSalleCMS v2 come to fruition, in the way that I envisioned, it is incredible to see it actually happening!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, wishing you a profitable month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

You recall:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;symbiotic_a.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;symbiotic_b.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who ever heard of&nbsp; a &ldquo;light version of Joomla!&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is &ldquo;Joomla Lite&rdquo; anyways?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, is Anahita and the Nooku Framework &mdash; ahem, excuse me, the Nooku&nbsp;<em>Platform</em>, even Joomla technologies? Are these ascendent Joomla technologies, or an ascendent technologies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the Anahita website for some help with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well&hellip; have you seen this blog post? It&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;<em>Anahita is not a Joomla extension</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2011/02/anahita-is-not-a-joomla-extension/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anahita is not a Joomla extension\">(http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2011/02/anahita-is-not-a-joomla-extension/</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Joomla times are a-changin&rsquo;. I think the times are a-changin&rsquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to read a good chunk of this post to you. This is an excerpt only &mdash; I&rsquo;ve edited it for the sake of brevity. The full post is at blog dot anahitapolis dot com.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Some of our good members specially those who are coming from the Joomla community are under the impression that Anahita Social Engine is a Joomla extension or an extension developed for Joomla. We even had a couple of people who paid a membership fee expecting to download an installable Joomla extension from Anahitapolis&hellip; So if we haven&rsquo;t been clear enough here is another announcement:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anahita&trade; Social Engine is not a Joomla extension! nor distributed as a Joomla extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;2 years ago, we did build the early releases of Anahita as a Joomla extension. We even released the alpha1 as an installable extension. It was only over time that we have developed a through [sic] framework specialized for developing social apps [so]&nbsp;<strong>Anahita evolved to become a stand alone platform</strong>&nbsp;and framework as a social networking solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today Anahita Social Engine is the collection of 3 powerful frameworks (Anahita, Nooku, and Gantry) that are shipped in a container called Joomla!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Anahita Social Engine we are using a<strong>stripped down version of Joomla! 1.5</strong>, because the platform aspects of Joomla such as it&rsquo;s extension management, menu management, and user authentication did the job quite nicely and there was no point for us to rebuild those from scratch. We have also made some upgrades to Joomla so it can better accommodates [sic] Anahita Social Engine and Apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the later releases we have a keen interest to use the Nooku Server as a much lighter web platform for building Anahita which could provide some really neat features such as multisite-social networks!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;our goal&hellip; is to build next generation technologies that help people connect and collaborate in highly effective and efficient ways. Our goal is not to build and nurture CMS technologies. That responsibility is left to projects such as Joomla, WordPress, or Drupal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also do not think that attaching social networking to a CMS will work out quite well. It is like trying to attach wings to a car and make it fly. It will be a lot more sensible to help the passengers get out of the car and get on an airplane!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The Space Shuttle jettisons its great external fuel towers once it is in flight. The take-off requires so much external power that the fuel towers dwarf the Space Shuttle itself. Now that Anahita is in flight, Joomla will be fully discarded, in favour of Nooku.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, calling Nooku &amp; Anahita &ldquo;Joomla technologies&rdquo; is incorrect now. We have to look at them as stand-alone technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>', 1, '2015-08-30 07:29:52', 1, '2015-08-30 07:29:52', 1, NULL, NULL);

Power that is accessible. At your fingertips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have surveyed non-Joomla independent PHP carts. There is no silver bullet. There is no magic solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each independent PHP cart has it&rsquo;s good points and bad points. There is choice out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I am unsatisfied with these choices. Because I am greedy. Because I do not want to choose. Because I do not want trade-offs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want it all!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want power!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because, people who come to me want power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People who come to me want an ecommerce platform powering profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want templates.<br />\r\nYou want customized business rules.<br />\r\nYou want integration with Joomla.<br />\r\nYou want features galore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why I am rejecting all the independent PHP carts. All of them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These PHP carts do not relieve me of the issues that drove me into their arms. Oh no, these carts confront me, and us, with their own particular variations of the issues we face with Joomla ecommerce. And, frequently, present us with new issues we did not have with Joomla ecommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have three core issues with the independent PHP carts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>templating wrestlemania;</li>\r\n	<li>no Joomla integration;</li>\r\n	<li>feature freeze.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There are independent PHP carts that do templating and Joomla better than others. Some have nicer feature sets than others. There&rsquo;s a wide range of independent PHP carts to choose from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I left Joomla, I realized how much I need Joomla. All the extensions. The flexibility. The templating. Joomla is powerful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No cart is a feature nirvana. Each has its feature set. Each has its development road map. Each has its ability to customize the source code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about new features? New features are published when they are published. Third parties may have what you need, or someone can program something for you. Or maybe there&rsquo;s something in the forums. Or maybe you are just plain SOL. Sounds just like the Joomla ecommerce I came from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The independent PHP carts are not compelling enough for me to leave Joomla ecommerce. In a way, it&rsquo;s better to fight than flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am specializing in Tienda and Nooku together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda&rsquo;s development is coming along. I will push it along, starting with my Canadian Edition of Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a Canada Post shipping plugin sitting unfinished in the development version. I will finish that up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m 90% sure that the Canadian retail taxes &ndash; HST/PST/GST &ndash; will work out-of-the-box, in part due to my multiple tax line modification request I submitted a while ago. I will test this out and see. If all I need are extra SQL statements in the installation, great. If it needs more than that, fine. I will also create a tax reporting extension using the Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a Moneris payment plugin sitting unfinished in the development version. I will dig into this as well, when Canada Post and the Canadian taxes are done first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to point something out to you. The Tienda shipping and payment plugins are regular Joomla plugins. Some extensions have their own plugins. Well, not Tienda. So I can polish up the Canada Post shipping plugin without touching Tienda itself .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My tax reporting extension will be done using the Nooku Framework. I will not have to touch Tienda at all. This will be a regular extension installed via the regular Joomla installer. Of course, it will be pre-installed in my Canadian Edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a sponsor to build a Tienda California Edition. California has approximately 1,200 municipal tax rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda does have a PayPal Pro payment plugin included in the current &ldquo;7.1&rdquo; version. However, it does not install, as this plugin is not included in the installation&rsquo;s XML file. I will definitely add this to the XML in my packages. However, I want to take the PayPal Pro plugin through its paces first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will avoid touching Tienda&rsquo;s source files as much as possible. But, at some point, my scalpel is going to make precise incisions in the Tienda source code. No way I&rsquo;m going to take the liberties with the source PHP I was compelled to make with Virtuemart. No need to take such liberties with Tienda. Still, there will be some surgery at some point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the things I programmed in Virtuemart &mdash; such as gift wrap, very involved custom coupons, dynamic pricing, and dynamic add-to-cart and delete-from-cart &mdash; I have on my radar. I&rsquo;m already getting murmurs about programming gift cards &mdash; which involve a transactional sub-system. Get that baby in by American Thanksgiving, eh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like my Virtuemart add-ons, I will seek feature sponsors to fund feature development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will set up a web site to distribute and support my handiwork. However, at this exact moment, I&rsquo;m not completely sure how I want to go about it. So first things first. First, I will seek feature sponsors and get my first editions of Tienda done. Then, I will set up a web site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two things I am sure of: there will be no free downloads; and, no free support. The profit margins on free are really thin!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sign up to my new Tienda-Nooku email list on my Media site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 1, '2015-08-31 17:23:23', 1, '2015-08-31 17:23:23', 1, NULL, NULL),
(37, 73, 3, 'Tbbs33', '<p><strong>Bob:</strong>Welcome to episode 33 of &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. Today is Thursday, May 26, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David de Boer joins me today for my first interview this year on &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David is the founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chillcreations.com/\" title=\"Chill Creations\">ChillCreations.com</a>. Nicholas mentioned one of David&rsquo;s Joomla extensions, &ldquo;ccInvoice&rdquo;, on&nbsp;episode 5 of The Round Table Show (a podcast I&#39;ve deprecated -- Bob.). Not being familiar with this extension, I looked it up. A very interesting site&hellip; hmmm, I should contact David for an interview. And here we are!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this first of two segments, we get to know David and ChillCreations.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our second of two segments, we talk about JAB11,&nbsp; and the changing Joomla development environment.&nbsp; David attended JAB11 and has a different perspective than my Round Table guests &mdash; whose podcast about JAB11 I just published at<a href=\"http://southlasallemedia.com/2011/trts7\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Round Table Show #7: Jooma JAB - Symbiosis\">http://southlasallemedia.com/2011/trts7</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>David, I notice you started Chill Creations while at University?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David de Boer:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, correct and actually I even stopped university to continue working on ChillCreations and I&rsquo;m not sure a lot of people are school dropouts because of Joomla but Joomla should feel ashamed because it caused me to dropout.&nbsp; I do know that a lot of people working in Joomla actually came from other professions first.&nbsp; So they worked as site developers, they were, for example, engineers or working somewhere else and now started working with Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You dropped out of university because of Joomla?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t say because of Joomla but primarily because I&rsquo;m really an entrepeuneur and that sounds nice in English, in Dutch it sounds more boring, and that I actually dropped out of university because I am an entrepeuneur and the way I was being taught things in university didn&rsquo;t match my learning style.&nbsp; So I had advice from an education expert/specialist whatever, and he told me, &ldquo;well this isn&rsquo;t going to work for you, you learn in a different way, so you could consider dropping out&rdquo;, and I did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I thought the standard career path if you&rsquo;re dropping out is to go to Harvard, and then you drop out of Harvard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, we don&rsquo;t have Harvard in the Netherlands and I had a nice girlfriend at the moment and I wasn&rsquo;t planning on going to the U.S. just to drop out of Harvard. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I went to, they call themselves &ldquo;The Harvard of the North&rdquo; &ndash; University of Toronto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I went to the Harvard of the Lowlands&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I deserve that!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; The Hague University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Now there are several things that caught my eye about your site. I think it pressed hot buttons. You have Virtuemart extensions (I&rsquo;m a Virtuemart specialist), you have a blog post entitled &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.chillcreations.com/blog/10-company/284-we-will-not-release-extensions-for-joomla-16.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ChillCreationsBlog+%28Chill+Creations+Blog%29&amp;utm_content=FeedBurner\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"No Joomla! 1.6 extensions from Chill Creations\">No Joomla! 1.6 extensions from Chill Creations</a>&rdquo; (David and Nicholas on my Round Table Show have talked about that), and you an invoice extension.&nbsp; I wanted to hit these one-by-one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>In your blog post, you say that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to maintain different versions of our extensions for Joomla! 1.5 and 1.6&Prime; and &ldquo;Joomla! 1.6 is a &lsquo;short term support&rsquo; version and will be at the end of life in 4 months&rdquo;.&nbsp; I was thinking how will Joomla&rsquo;s separating its CMS &amp; platform development affect your extension development?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I don&rsquo;t think that the separation of the platform and the CMS will have a big effect on extension developers or end users in the near future.&nbsp; Because as extension developers for the CMS we still have to focus on the platform version in the CMS.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t use another platform version because our end users, our customers, will be using the platform version in the CMS.&nbsp; So we&rsquo;ll still be focusing on Joomla at the CMS and not Joomla at the platform as extension developers that build solutions for end users.&nbsp; Is that logical? Does that sound understandable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s so early for splitting the development, it&rsquo;s hard to know where to take it.&nbsp; You write in your blog post that you&rsquo;re kind of going to wait and see about 1.7 and 1.8? So I&rsquo;m thing thinking just from the other shows I&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s hard for the extension developers to plan and they kind of have to wait for Joomla to settle down a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah that&rsquo;s true, but I really think this is only temporary because Joomla has shifted to the new development strategy where there is a release every six months.&nbsp; And I think it&rsquo;s really temporary that we, the extension developers, and we not just extension developers also, for example, people that develop training for Joomla or video tutorials.&nbsp; We just have to, or we should take a risk and hope that our decisions are correct in the long run or we should sit back a little and see how these new developments pan out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And see if you get a demand to create extensions for the new versions.&nbsp; Moving on to Virtuemart, I found Virtuemart is for me, a declining area to be in.&nbsp; And you have Virtuemart extensions and you don&rsquo;t have extensions for other carts.&nbsp; So is it stronger in Europe than here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it is very strong in the Netherlands, I&rsquo;m not sure about the rest of Europe.&nbsp; I know that my sales are not declining for those extensions.&nbsp; I have been saying for about a year now that I think that Virtuemart will become less popular in the future because of the other shopping cart extensions like Red Shop and Tienda, etc.&nbsp; But until now I still believe that, but my sales don&rsquo;t communicate that.&nbsp; My sales are still increasing, so I&rsquo;m starting to believe that end users don&rsquo;t really care about the spaghetti code in Virtuemart.&nbsp; [laughter] I don&rsquo;t want to, but if I look at my sales and look at what my customers are saying, they are just still installing Virtuemart even knowing that there are other extensions out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe the Virtuemart extensions are a good place to be in, but the consulting, I am finding, it&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t been for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think if you look on a higher scale that consulting for Joomla, because I&rsquo;ve also done that, I&rsquo;ve done web development and web design activities and consulting activities until 2009 when I switched to extensions full-time, and I can agree that it looks like there is a lot more competition, especially in the Netherlands, of people doing the same activities.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s probably harder now than it was in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>Well, I didn&rsquo;t want to get into a big Virtuemart discussion, it&rsquo;s probably a subconscious thing.&nbsp; Just the kind of clients who want to get into in are probably more amenable to buying extensions and add-ons than the consulting.&nbsp; Are you thinking of porting your Virtuemart extensions to other carts as a diversification?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;No, not at the moment because I still don&rsquo;t see a lot of users asking for ports.&nbsp; We do have one extension but that&rsquo;s really specific to the Netherlands that adds the Dutch payment method Ideal to Inkashop, which is also one of those e-commerce extensions.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s actually the only one at the moment and I don&rsquo;t get a lot of people asking for extensions for the other shopping cart extensions, but that could well be because we communicate a lot about Virtuemart and they just think they should have asked us.&nbsp; So, I&rsquo;m not planning to do it anyway and I don&rsquo;t see a lot of questions at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>Are you compelled to touch the Virtuemart source code when you do your extensions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;No, we&rsquo;ve done this with my first extension that we released in 2008 which has a few Virtuemart hacks and it&rsquo;s a profitable extension but it&rsquo;s really a pain supporting it and helping customers, so in the latest extensions ccVOAM which adds invoicing and advanced order management to Virtuemart we don&rsquo;t hack Virtuemart at all because of the bad experience you had previously.&nbsp; So the only thing we do is communicate with the Virtuemart database but we don&rsquo;t do anything in files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Right.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when you can just play with the database, it&rsquo;s great!&nbsp; Then you can write just Joomla extensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so it&rsquo;s really coded better than Virtuemart 1.1 obviously, and it&rsquo;s just really stable because we only work with the database, so no core hacks &ndash; hallelujah!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Amen! Now I haven&rsquo;t installed or looked at your extensions, but you have an invoice extension for Joomla and one for Virtuemart.&nbsp; What is the difference?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, the difference is that I built the invoicing extension for Virtuemart from my personal need because my wife and I have or have had a few web shops in the past and for Virtuemart you don&rsquo;t just need invoicing, you need advanced order management if your shop is a little bit bigger than most shops.&nbsp; So if you&rsquo;re getting thousands to tens of thousands of revenue per month instead of a few hundred, then you really need a way to more efficiently manage your orders.&nbsp; So the ccVOAM extension adds invoicing but most importantly adds advanced order management where you can batch process your orders and that&rsquo;s the biggest difference between&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chillcreations.com/joomla-extensions/ccvaom-virtuemart-advanced-order-management-invoice-batching-download.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Virtuemart invoicing/billing\">ccVOAM</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chillcreations.com/joomla-extensions/ccinvoices-online-pdf-invoicing-billing-orders-joomla.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Joomla! invoicing/billing\">ccInvoices</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Is that the batching is changing order status from pending to confirmed?&nbsp; That sort of thing. or shipped or whatever?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s actually I think we&rsquo;ve got everything covered that you would want to do.&nbsp; You can batch-download orders so select, well you could look at the demo video later, but you could say I want all the orders from the last week I want to batch download them as PDF and click &ldquo;go&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll get a batch with maybe 300 orders.&nbsp; You could also select four orders and then say change order status to shipped and email client.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s click, click, click done!&nbsp; And if you would do this in Virtuemart it would be click, click, click times four &ndash; because you would have to do it for every individual order separately. And, now different actions are they are almost automated as you just select the orders and then say what you want to do with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This is my 58th podcast in a year and a half and I kind of coming in a little cold and then having the interview and then looking later at the demo stuff if I&rsquo;m not familiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Extensions such as yours actually extend the useful life of Virtuemart, so it&rsquo;s very important to the Virtuemart eco-system, the things that you&rsquo;re doing.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t looked at ccInvoices and Nicholas was [referencing] it on the show, in context with his new Akeeba Subscriptions.&nbsp; Saying I don&rsquo;t need to build an invoicing feature on my subscriptions extension because there&rsquo;s ccInvoices, but ccInvoices you said doesn&rsquo;t integrate with anything, it&rsquo;s a stand alone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;At the moment it&rsquo;s a stand alone extension and I&rsquo;m really pro integration. I&rsquo;d really love to work more with other extension developers so we don&rsquo;t all develop our own extensions but have a little bit of integration so we can focus on more innovation instead of competition. But, it doesn&rsquo;t integrate with any other extension at the moment because we&rsquo;re just not that far yet.&nbsp; But it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard for Nicholas to integrate it with Akeeba Subscriptions because ccInvoices is a really simple extension and one way to do it would be just to add the details from Akeeba Subscriptions into our database tables and otherwise I also propose to him we could add a plug-in event so if there was a certain action in ccInvoices then it would update the data to Akeeba Subscriptions also. But, it won&rsquo;t be hard in any way to integrate ccInvoices with any other extension.&nbsp; If the other extension is of course very complex, it will be harder but it should be possible because we&rsquo;re trying to keep this in mind while we&rsquo;re developing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So, for instance, as a consultant I could use ccInvoices to create invoices that I will use to bill my clients and it will create PDF&rsquo;s that I can send them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, and it also sends from the interface so you don&rsquo;t have to get a PDF, put it in your email program, click send, etc., you just click send in ccInvoices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and if my client is a user on my Joomla site, then they can log in and see a history of their invoices?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:&nbsp;</strong>Yup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and does that integrate with your ticketing extension?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re probably talking about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chillcreations.com/indev-extensions/cchelpdesk.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"integrated support solution for Joomla!\">ccHelpdesk</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of the extensions on our site but it&rsquo;s listed on our site as an &ldquo;indev&rdquo; extension or in development extension.&nbsp; Yeah that&rsquo;s actually a section I use to get feedback on ideas, so it&rsquo;s not an actual extension that can be used by our end customers at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I thought &ldquo;indev&rdquo; was a subsidiary or a partner, that&rsquo;s what I thought indev was!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, more people get that, so in the next few months I&rsquo;ll remove that section and I&rsquo;ll move the extensions to the normal drop down on the website when they are ready.&nbsp; But my plan or my goal is always to integrate our own extensions and integrate with other extensions from other developers, so when it&rsquo;s done it will definitely be integrated on some level, of course we have to see what&rsquo;s logical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I feel that you&rsquo;re brave about having a newsletter extension.&nbsp; Because there&rsquo;s a lot of other newsletter extensions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus you know, there&rsquo;s sofware as a service sites.&nbsp; Is that a good segment to be in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:&nbsp;</strong>Well, interesting enough we were, I believe, the first or the second Joomla 1.5 newsletter extension.&nbsp; So, it wasn&rsquo;t really brave at that time because at that moment I was still consulting and I needed a newsletter extension for a few of my clients and there was SBS newsletter which wasn&rsquo;t developed anymore so we kind of ported that and kept improving it for our own use. And, on a Blue Monday I decided to give it away as a free extension and well that was the best and worst decision in my development career, so we were already there.&nbsp; So all the SaaS solutions&nbsp; and the other extensions kind of came almost came later, at least I didn&rsquo;t know about them at the moment. So, I&rsquo;m not sure I was brave.&nbsp; I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have done it again today if I knew about the current situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Why was it the best and the worst decision?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, the best because it was in the beginning a lot of fun to see that we had tens of thousands of users using it.&nbsp; That was just great, and the worst, because support.&nbsp; It was a free extension, there was really no commercial part or section or any way for me to earn any money with it, so we were doing support for free and development for free and after a few years that really adds up, in our case.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not free anymore since last month.&nbsp; It was listed commercial on the JED for some time now but you could still find a free download link if you looked good but now it&rsquo;s really completely commercial because support was really a pain in the ass, for at least us &ndash; other developers have more success with the free/commercial model but not me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, you didn&rsquo;t have a commercial version and a free version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So there&rsquo;s no conversion for upgrades or for the professional support because it was all free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, exactly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve played with the idea and I really have it as a &ldquo;Seniors Letter Pro&rdquo; on the shelf, it&rsquo;s been there for about a year but I just didn&rsquo;t release it because I was still kind of finding my own way, how do I want to build extensions? What&rsquo;s important for me and I&rsquo;m starting to see that easy-to-use extensions is the way I want to go and having a pro version of every extension doesn&rsquo;t really fit into that idea, because then you just have a huge extended.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to build a pro version with a lot of functions just so I can make money.&nbsp; I want to make a great extension that works for everybody or a lot of people without thinking about money up front. And, if I was going to release the pro version it would be purely for the money to get some return on investment on the free version, and well, that&rsquo;s just the wrong motivation, at least I think it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well that&rsquo;s funny, it&rsquo;s a hot button because we talked about this at length on the other one, it&rsquo;s interesting what your experience is and that you just took it off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but that was a hard decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well 10,000 users to support for free is &hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Tens of thousands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Tens of thousands, it&rsquo;s like a tsunami.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;To share the numbers, because I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s a good idea but, it was expensive in the last few years.&nbsp; Really expensive.&nbsp; Because I tracked everything, I tracked hours worked and everything, not even my own hours but my developers hours.&nbsp; So I know exactly what it cost me and it wasn&rsquo;t cheap and some people said, well then you&rsquo;re probably sell more of for example ccInvoices. Well, I have the numbers and I know that that&rsquo;s not true.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t sell a lot more ccInvoices to compensate for the costs in supporting free ccNewsletter.&nbsp; But I know other people have different experiences, I know that Fotis of K2 for example, he really likes the free versus commercial idea and that other developers have a free version and a commercial version and it can work for them but it just didn&rsquo;t work for me and yeah there could be different reasons why not.&nbsp; It just didn&rsquo;t work, so I&rsquo;m changing what I&rsquo;m doing to make sure that I have a system that does work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s phenomenal that you have a cost/benefit analysis and that you tried it.&nbsp; You tried it and then you went through the analysis.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s terrific.&nbsp; And Fotis has a community around K2 that helps to support it and has, you know, the forum and everything.&nbsp; Which is another effort but it&rsquo;s different.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s interesting the kinds of extensions that work to have a free and a community and a professional version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you taking a look at Molajo or Nooku?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I&rsquo;m actually aware of almost anything that&rsquo;s happening on those areas.&nbsp; So fire away with your questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>So, you&rsquo;re just waiting and seeing how they develop but not jumping in on anything yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;No, that&rsquo;s primarily because I don&rsquo;t think it &lsquo;s my position to jump into anything.&nbsp; If I was a Consultant I would definitely try to use Nooku server or Molajo in a small project to see if I could use them for clients.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m an extension developer and as an extension developer as a business I have to focus on extensions for the Joomla 1.5 and later 1.7, maybe, CMS, that&rsquo;s just the business part.&nbsp; Personally I&rsquo;m extremely interested in these developments in Molajo and Nooku Server and that&rsquo;s why personally I have installed them and played with them and I keep up to date with what&rsquo;s happening.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s really my personal time and as a business I don&rsquo;t see a reason to jump into that development at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob (closing):&nbsp;</strong>David, thank you for being here; and, thank you for sponsoring today&rsquo;s show transcripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first of two segments today with David de Boer of ChillCreations.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(38, 74, 3, 'Tbbs34', '<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome to episode 34 of &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. Today is Thursday, May 26, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David de Boer joins me today for my first interview this year on &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David is the founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chillcreations.com/\" title=\"Chill Creations\">ChillCreations.com</a>. Nicholas mentioned one of David&rsquo;s Joomla extensions, &ldquo;ccInvoice&rdquo;, on&nbsp;episode 5 of&nbsp; The Round Table Show (this podcast show is deprecated -Bob.). Not being familiar with this extension, I looked it up. A very interesting site&hellip; hmmm, maybe I should contact David for an interview. And here we are!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our first of two segments, we got to know David and ChillCreations.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this second of two segments, we talk about JAB11,&nbsp; and the changing Joomla development environment.&nbsp; David attended JAB11 and has a different perspective than my Round Table guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You went to Joomla And Beyond &rsquo;11 which was almost around the corner from you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, there was a three hour train trip, but yeah.&nbsp; Compared to people coming from New Zealand it was pretty close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;What were your impressions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;It was great, it was a lot more open that I expected.&nbsp; You could really talk to anybody and I thought well maybe the real experts know the celebrities of Joomla are maybe high in an ivory tower, but it wasn&rsquo;t true.&nbsp; You could really talk to anybody and ask questions and everybody was very open, and the beer was okay.&nbsp; [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s why they were so accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, and Ebay of course sponsored the community event on Saturday so they paid for the barbecue and for the beer and I&rsquo;ve heard rumours that that cost them about 5,000 euros.&nbsp; So that was really nice, thank you Ebay.&nbsp; And well I already had a proposal to ask Microsoft to sponsor the community event next year, because they still have something to make up to us for Internet Explorer 6.&nbsp; So maybe we&rsquo;ll get them that far. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh I hope they&rsquo;re not listening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not going to say I don&rsquo;t care because before you know it, Skype doesn&rsquo;t work for me anymore [laughter] Microsoft, let&rsquo;s not get into that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Have I missed something about your extensions or your site that you wanted to bring up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I can comment on the no Joomla 1.6 extension, because some people misinterpreted that as a statement against 1.6 and it&rsquo;s actually not really about 1.6 it&rsquo;s about I&rsquo;m egocentrical few &mdash; that&rsquo;s the way you say it in English?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about me.&nbsp; The reason we&rsquo;re not doing Joomla 1.6 extensions is primarily because we&rsquo;re not ready to shift our development style to support two Joomla versions.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re still really in start-up phase, it&rsquo;s been a year but we&rsquo;re still really in start-up phase developing new features for current extensions and developing new extensions, so it&rsquo;s not logical for us to start converting them to another Joomla version and then adding the features to two versions or any other solution.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s not a statement against Joomla 1.6 per se.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B0b:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an effort to commit to the versions and you have to make a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;To go from Joomla 1.0 to 1.5 was no decision, you just did it.&nbsp; but now it&rsquo;s not as cut and dried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah exactly.&nbsp; For a number of reasons, but I have this idea and I&rsquo;m not sure you agree or other people agree.&nbsp; But I have this idea that one of the people that really, in English, the people that were really there during the 1.0 to 1.5 conversion were the template developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Um hum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;They were.&nbsp; I mean huge companies at that time and extension developers were also there but not as huge for example RocketTheme or JoomlaArt.&nbsp; And I wonder, I&rsquo;m not sure, but I wonder that the 1.0 to 1.5 conversion might have been one of the reasons that the template developers decided to start developing template frameworks.&nbsp; Because JoomlaArt or RocketTheme etc. now have their own frameworks&hellip;&nbsp; so converting their templates to a new Joomla version is really easy for them [<a href=\"http://www.rockettheme.com/blog/joomla/1070-update-on-joomla-16-conversion-progress\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Update on Joomla 1.6 Conversion Progress\">probably not</a>&nbsp;-Bob] and I&rsquo;m wondering if the 1.0 to 1.5 conversion might be one of the maybe subconscious reasons to develop a template framework because as an extension developer if you knew about it then it wouldn&rsquo;t be a strange idea to develop extension framework about a year or two ago and then you would have your extensions working on 1.6 a lot easier than now converting to the new 1.6 framework.&nbsp; Does that sound logical?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s worthy of a few shows.&nbsp; My theory is there was an honest reason why they built up their own little template frameworks because they were doing the same underlying things every time for their new extensions [I meant &ldquo;templates&rdquo;], so they wanted to genericize some functions so that they could concentrate on the template and not the underlying engine that drove it.&nbsp; And then I think as that grew they also had &ndash; I forget the term &ndash; they could also develop features that were unique to them that would work with their templates by putting it in the framework.&nbsp; So instead of having a module, they could put it in the framework and that sort of ties you also to the templates and the other thing is a diversification.&nbsp; Because they&rsquo;re trying to take the frameworks and putting them into other CMS&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and I find that&rsquo;s a canary in the coal mine, watching them diversify out of Joomla; and, I find that very fascinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, me too and definitely from a business perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So fascinating that it&rsquo;s going to be a topic on our next round table show!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s going to be an interesting one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Somehow you felt that ESP going?&nbsp; I find the template developers are a bit of a canary in the coal mine, they seem very sensitive to the business aspect and I saw them diversifying out of Joomla, I thought either they hit a bit of a top in how much business they could get from Joomla so they&rsquo;re diversifying; or, they&rsquo;re diversifying out because&nbsp; just in case Joomla isn&rsquo;t as hot, then they&rsquo;ll be in the other thing and if the other thing&rsquo;s not as hot and Joomla picks up then they&rsquo;ll be in Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I agree.&nbsp; I think what I&rsquo;m noticing at least is that most template developers are as a business more mature than extension developers because they are mostly older and because they are older their business are more mature and they have issues like this and make decisions like this and decide to diversify.&nbsp; If a company is really new like my company for example, we can&rsquo;t diversify any time soon because we&rsquo;re still building our Joomla business and for a company like RocketTheme which has everything done and ready and the processes are all stable then the next step is to increase your profit and if that doesn&rsquo;t happen within Joomla, yeah it could be worth it looking at Druple or WordPress or PHPbb or anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I don&rsquo;t just want to say you know RocketTheme, I think all the template developers as a whole have the same type of issues because there are a lot of template developers and they have to differentiate themselves and they use the framework for that. Although they are mature they&rsquo;ve been around, there&rsquo;s pros and cons with that as well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want any flame emails after the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m really interested in what are the cons of being mature?&nbsp; So, please please tell me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;A con of being mature is that you have a lot of templates that you have to go back in retrospect and keep up to date, even though the revenue you get for updating that particular template doesn&rsquo;t really cover the cost of updating it, if you fail in keeping up with your portfolio of offerings, then the optics aren&rsquo;t very good to the public who may decide to go with someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a struggle to keep up to date just as you are deciding whether you should go to 1.7, 1.6 or whatever, they have to look back at what they already have and they sort of have it in reverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t see any of the template developers really communicate this very clearly but most of them are starting with converting their templates to a new Joomla version for example, with the newest template.&nbsp; So the one that&rsquo;s the most up to date with design trends, etc.&nbsp; And then going backward.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure but I think that a few of the template developers didn&rsquo;t convert their oldest templates at the moment and I&rsquo;m wondering if they ever will.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t communicate that they won&rsquo;t, but maybe they will just never convert their first template because I can imagine that almost nobody wants to use it anymore. Because, if you look at the old templates from Joomla or the Rocket Theme then you see that the design is old.&nbsp; You know we have web design trends with the way you style buttons, and they are really old templates, you wouldn&rsquo;t really use them on a new website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well and the problem is the old ones aren&rsquo;t on Gantry or T3 or whatever, they&rsquo;re just the predecessors to how they got to developing a template framework in the first place, so they&rsquo;re probably saying &ldquo;you know what I don&rsquo;t really want to convert that now because there&rsquo;s no money in it&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And my experience with RocketTheme, I&rsquo;ve worked with RocketTheme over the years more than any other and I&rsquo;ve worked with the older ones and the older ones are different, it&rsquo;s like a different person worked on them and they have different ways of doing it.&nbsp; So, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to go back to the really old ones which some of them had really neat ideas.&nbsp; But also I guess that&rsquo;s one reason&nbsp; they went to a template framework because then they could have many developers working on them in a standardized way.&nbsp; You can see when, again, RocketTheme is just an example because I&rsquo;m so familiar with them compared to the others, converting to WordPress.&nbsp; It takes time.&nbsp; The ones that are on Gantry and Joomla it takes time to get them on WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not only a technical thing you have to do it&rsquo;s also, at least I believe, it&rsquo;s also understanding the WordPress community and how you can have a business model&nbsp; that works in that community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to blow the discussion I&rsquo;m going to have, but you can see I like to know that it&rsquo;s topical and it&rsquo;s one reason why I want to elongate this conversation, you brought something up very well, but there are symmetries between do you go to Joomla 1.6 to Joomla 1.7 or even to Nooku and you can see a corollary with how they go to WordPress or how long it takes the Drupal version because they committed to that.&nbsp; And you can see how long it takes and I wonder if the numbers support it.&nbsp; But now if they don&rsquo;t have that portfolio then you know, you get dissonance when people purchase for Druple and that version&rsquo;s not there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Nicholas, David Deutsch, and talked about the WordPress and Drupal, but subsequently decided not to do a Round Table about &lsquo;em, since we don&rsquo;t work with &lsquo;em. eg: this site is in WordPress, but I&rsquo;ve not maintained a live Drupal site. This site uses a child theme based on a WordPress theme developer&rsquo;s own custom theme framework. It makes sense to have a WP theme framework, because a WP leaves it to the theme to do a lot of heavy lifting. Why should a theme developer have to recreate that heavy lifting each time they do a theme. Interestingly, WP theme framework/theme cost more than buying a Joomla template. -Bob]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I think that also more of a communication problem and I&rsquo;m not sure if everybody is really thinking enough about the business aspect for going to WordPress or going to Drupal because for example, not to point any fingers, but you see that JoomlaArt did Drupal and they said I believe a few months ago that they were going to pause Drupal template development because they were running into issues and I think that&rsquo;s not exactly a technical problem because, yeah well CSS and html is html ,but more of a business problem that there are really differences between the Drupal and WordPress and Joomla communities, also in very basic things such as pricing &ndash; what is a Drupal developer ready to pay for an extension and what does a WordPress developer want to pay.&nbsp; So you can develop it but you also have to think about how you&rsquo;re going to sell it and support it, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and maintain it.&nbsp; I think the devil is in the details and don&rsquo;t discover all the issues that are involved until you get into it and now you&rsquo;re into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s brave from JoomlaArt to then say okay we&rsquo;re taking a pause and rethinking this, that&rsquo;s a brave decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s a brave decision that you decided you were just going to release your extension for free and see how it goes.&nbsp; And because you have to try it a lot of the times to understand if it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a, talk about chicken and egg.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s, just like you said, Drupal has different issues than Joomla but if your speciality is Joomla you sort of learn as you go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s funny to see the framework development for themes in WordPress versus the frameworks in Joomla.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just leave the appetizer and we&rsquo;ll dig into that on the Round Table show &ndash; it&rsquo;s different but the same.&nbsp; I think once the template developers got into WordPress, you know they discovered as they went along, you know you can&rsquo;t just pour what you did in Joomla to like Nooku.&nbsp; You just installed Nooku as a component and then the plug-in you just enabled a plug-in and it says okay Nooku&rsquo;s there, I don&rsquo;t think it quite works that way in WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well they did have Nooku running in WordPress I&rsquo;m sure you were aware of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, Stian ran a test and that sort of worked. [<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/stipsan/status/8485611765764096\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nooku on WordPress tweet\">http://twitter.com/#!/stipsan/status/8485611765764096</a>&nbsp;-Bob]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah you still get as, I dropped out of College or University or whatever so I can&rsquo;t call myself a &ldquo;Usability Expert&rdquo;, I can&rsquo;t call myself anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But all the brilliant developers, you know, drop out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, well I like to be compared to Steve Jobs and he dropped out, so there you go.&nbsp; But you can develop a Joomla extension and maybe run it in WordPress but WordPress has a different user interface and different icons and a different way of working.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m not sure that a Joomla extension developed on Nooku framework working in WordPress would be nice enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Sure David, my Round Table show has two subscription developers, so I should have them on this show.&nbsp; You perfectly telegraphed a branch of the discussion that we&rsquo;re going to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;[laughing] maybe you should use this as an intro to that discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I will and it&rsquo;s topical.&nbsp; But the issues are similar from what you have and what they have just, you know, sort of different cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, different flavours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m, you know with Joomla they have to be careful, just be careful because it&rsquo;s such an investment in the versions.&nbsp; So I think they tried something and they&rsquo;re trying to settle down and I think the existence of Nooku and the existence of Molajo is actually going to help Joomla settle down, I think they&rsquo;re going to find their level of how they&rsquo;re going to proceed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah and it looks like everybody is getting their place because of these new projects.&nbsp; So you have the people working on the Joomla core and you have the people on Molajo or on Nooku and the people on Nooku and also on Molajo actually really want to be at the burning edge of innovation and the Joomla core just I think can&rsquo;t be there because it&rsquo;s used by so many websites and users.&nbsp; But now the people that want to do these great improvements to user friendly interface like a new template in Molajo &ndash; they have a place to go and to develop to show this to the world and well the big hope of everyone of course is that these innovations eventually make it back to the Joomla core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Or, they cross pollinate and so they don&rsquo;t have to wait for the Joomla core it&rsquo;s, you know if it&rsquo;s in Nooku and Nooku works with Molajo theoretically or Joomla, then it won&rsquo;t matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, well we&rsquo;re very much in the beginning of these developments still so we have to see how the details really pan out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think we&rsquo;re looking at fragmentation.&nbsp; I listened to the Molajo people on JoomStew yesterday and I kept saying in my head &ldquo;fragmentation, fragmentation&rdquo;.&nbsp; Joomla&rsquo;s already different than say WordPress because WordPress is unified but Joomla, it&rsquo;s fragmenting and it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well besides that it&rsquo;s a good, it&rsquo;s the way Joomla is and in the past we&rsquo;ve had a lot of people saying Joomla should be more of this or that, more Drupal or more WordPress.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not a founder or whatever, I&rsquo;m not here since the beginning so I see things with my own eyes and not with what I think they should be and what I&rsquo;ve seen since the beginning is that Joomla has always been fragmented and there&rsquo;s always been competition and I&rsquo;m wondering if maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t accept that and that we won&rsquo;t be a Drupal that&rsquo;s really focused on collaboration a lot but will be more fragmented and you have Molajo doing their own thing and Nooku doing their own thing and Joomla doing their own thing.&nbsp; Maybe that&rsquo;s just the way the Joomla community works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;At Joomla and Beyond I think the most photographed event was that eBay barbecue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Probably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Because those are the photos I&rsquo;ve seen the most and it was fascinating looking at the T-shirt people were wearing.&nbsp; There was a lot of Nooku, there was a lot of &hellip;..</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, they&rsquo;re in the corner, I have two, three, four, five, six, six t-shirts from Joomla and Beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and what are the logos on those?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll grab them.&nbsp; Well there is the What Nothing? tshirt from Peter from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nonumber.nl/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"NoNumber.nl\">NoNumber.nl</a>&nbsp;and there&rsquo;s the tshirt from Microsfoft where they wisely didn&rsquo;t put their logo on because they did do that with the Dutch Joomla Days and they didn&rsquo;t get rid of the tshirts so they added the Joomla logo, and it says &ldquo;Make Web Not War&rdquo;, so that was also a popular one.&nbsp; Then we have the tshirt that says &ldquo;Code Strong&rdquo; from Accelerator, they developed the iPhone application for J and Beyond.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s the old J and Beyond tshirt in orange and the J and Beyond tshirt in blue.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one, two, three, four, five&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t get a black Nooku tshirt?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;No, because the Nooku guys were only giving those to Contributors.&nbsp; So I got a Nooku tshirt from a Nooku gentleman Robert [unintelligble]&nbsp; but I didn&rsquo;t get the contributor tshirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Ah hah.&nbsp; Well see I didn&rsquo;t know about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;If I knew about that I&rsquo;d ask Johan for the<a href=\"http://blog.nooku.org/2010/11/nooku-contributor-agreement/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nooku Contributor Agreement blog post\">contributor agreement</a>&nbsp;but I didn&rsquo;t, so I didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I looked at the pictures of everyone in different tshirts and noticed that there weren&rsquo;t exclusively Joomla tshirts and I got the visual impression that Joomla&rsquo;s a family.&nbsp; It was like a family gathering, that&rsquo;s my major takeaway of JAB &rsquo;11 are the pictures and to think of Joomla as a family and not as sort of a single unified&nbsp; thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well it is.&nbsp; I think I can agree on that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more of a group of people working and innovating on the web and not necessarily a group of people working and innovating on the Joomla CMS.&nbsp; At least it&rsquo;s not anymore.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all working on the web and we&rsquo;re going in different directions and the main reason we know each other and we&rsquo;re connected is because of the past we have in Joomla and it still connects us because it&rsquo;s still huge, of course, but we are more individuals and individually thinking and developing things and if you look at for example Drupal then you see that there is more a spirit of doing things together and sticking together.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not saying one is bad or the other is bad or good or whatever, I&rsquo;m just saying what I think I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think one reason it&rsquo;s good is you never know how technology is going to change and by being able to house sort of a lot of different technologies under you know, the family.&nbsp; Whatever happens in the world Joomla&rsquo;s going to be able to react and I think that&rsquo;s a big plus.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my personal opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well I agree but I&rsquo;m not going to say a lot about this because I really don&rsquo;t know a lot about politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh I&rsquo;m not talking about the politics.&nbsp; Just the different technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but I think for Joomla itself to benefit from the different technologies there has to be a way for the different technologies to get back to the core.&nbsp; Joomla itself has to have a benefit from otherwise it is a family but will just grow apart and maybe the reason we&rsquo;re a family in the first place will fade.&nbsp; All the stuff that&rsquo;s happening around Joomla, that&rsquo;s of course the clue &ndash; it&rsquo;s happening around Joomla and Joomla itself has to some way get the benefits of that so I almost feel as if I&rsquo;m, how do you say that, I have to do this because I have so much to thank the Joomla project for that the stuff that I am doing if in anyway possible, I should be giving back.&nbsp; And what you see now with Nooku and Molajo is that they are still having difficulties with finding a way how to give back, they want to, but there still have to be like a process or okay, how are we going to actually do this because we&rsquo;re just innovating and not looking back and how do we get the innovation back maybe at a later moment and if they figure that out then Joomla itself gets benefits and then it&rsquo;s the entire movement moving forward instead of just the people around the core that are not in the core but around the core.&nbsp; Some people will hate me for saying this but the third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well right now I&rsquo;m interpreting the CMS platform separation as a response to how do we put Nooku things in there or incorporate ideas we wanted to put in or how do we respond to whatever?&nbsp; Now they have two streams that don&rsquo;t necessarily tie in together so theoretically it makes Joomla more responsive.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have to wait but I think it&rsquo;s a good development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah and maybe we&rsquo;ll have to wait and I think it&rsquo;s also a good development but I&rsquo;m not aware of how exactly because I&rsquo;m not really a coder so that&rsquo;s a bit above my head or that&rsquo;s how we say it in Dutch.&nbsp; Because what is interesting is that Molajo decided to also become an application on the Joomla framework, so I&rsquo;m not sure but I believe it started as a version of Joomla 1.6 as a distribution and now they decided at J and Beyond they were talking about it to be an application on top of the framework so there is no Joomla CMS in Molajo in the future, there&rsquo;s only the Joomla framework and then a Molajo application layer and then the Molajo CMS on top of that.&nbsp; And that combined with the development that the Joomla team is separating the platform from the CMS, that&rsquo;s really interesting because it looks like, we&rsquo;ll have to see where it goes but it looks like eventually the platform will become more prominent on Jooml.org for example and the CMS will just be a flavour and you&rsquo;ll also have to flavour Molajo and maybe there will be different flavours of CMS on top of the framework but we&rsquo;ll really have to see how that works out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That was a great explanation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what&rsquo;s separating CMS and Platform means but that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Well they say platform but actually maybe it&rsquo;s easier to understand if we call it a framework, that&rsquo;s what it is and you have the framework which has all kinds of &ndash; I&rsquo;m not a developer so I can try to explain it in a non-developer way &ndash; you have the framework which has all kinds of code that you can reuse to build something on top of it that&rsquo;s easier to build because of the framework, you don&rsquo;t have to program everything yourself and separating that means that the CMS part we know so /administrator for example is a part of the CMS and the CMS part itself lives on top of the framework and because they are separate you can have a framework that is developing quicker than a CMS and then just decide well we can&rsquo;t have the CMS develop that fast so we&rsquo;ll just use an older framework/platform version for the CMS which is built on top of the framework and we&rsquo;ll just keep innovating the platform/framework separately from the CMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s reminiscent of what they were talking about on the JoomStew Show that I listened to yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I still have to catch that one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, a bit of a&nbsp; mixing and matching of, you know, you use this for this and that for that and this for this and then somebody asked well what about Gantry? and I&rsquo;m thinking&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;What does that have to do with anything?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip;will Gantry work in Molajo and I have to admit, I kind of lost the conversation but there seems to be, I&rsquo;m thinking maybe there&rsquo;s a trend towards, you know, fragmentation but also mixing and matching and it won&rsquo;t matter where something&rsquo;s developed because it will work in the other thing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all too nascent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not sure if Gantry for example is developed on the framework then and Molajo, for example, is also developed on the framework, then the Molajo people would still have to decide to support every framework function, I think, I&rsquo;m not a developer so correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It even gets worse because&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/author/crault\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chris Rault on SouthLaSalleMedia.com\">Chris Rault</a>&nbsp;of<a href=\"http://www.prothemer.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Prothemer.com blog\">ProThemer</a>&nbsp;[and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.joomlajunkie.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"JoomlaJunkie.com\">Joomla Junkie</a>], it&rsquo;s based on Nooku.&nbsp; The template framework [called &ldquo;Morph&rdquo;] is written in Nooku.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Really, is that in the wild or is it still in development?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Excuse me if I get the timing wrong, I think it&rsquo;s out.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s either in very late beta or it&rsquo;s been released.&nbsp; Stian was working on that.&nbsp; I have that in a podcast from last year and it&rsquo;s taken awhile to develop.&nbsp; You get all the details once you dive into it.&nbsp; So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s going to necessarily if the new Prothemer, sorry Chris, if it will work in Molajo at one point or whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on the parties, so if Nooku</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;He&rsquo;s breaking new ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah and a lot of people are at the moment with these projects we are talking about and it&rsquo;s a mutual thing.&nbsp; If the Nooku framework decides to fully support Molajo at all times and vice a versa on Molajo decides to support Nooku at all times, then of course it will work but if one of the two says &ldquo;well whatever we&rsquo;re not going to do it&rdquo; and there&rsquo;s something that breaks and they&rsquo;re not going to fix it, well then it won&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s more of a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement &ldquo;okay we&rsquo;ll support each other&rdquo; to have everything work together.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a standard.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that a new framework will work in the other framework by definition because they are really going their own way, so there has to be somebody that&rsquo;s going to test it and say &ldquo;hey, this doesn&rsquo;t work, will we fix it or not&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s part of the family [Godfather clip], you know, every door&rsquo;s open to the other family members.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s like can you use a Ford engine in a Chrysler pick up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, if the Ford</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not so much I&rsquo;m going to let you use it, it&rsquo;s you know, can you drop one in the other?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah and if Ford makes an adjustment to the engine so it hooks up to the Chrysler cable, then it&rsquo;s going to work or if Chrysler makes an adjustment to the car so it can connect to the Ford engine, then it&rsquo;s going to work but if both decide not to, then it&rsquo;s not going to work.&nbsp; Yeah, well exactly so it&rsquo;s going to be a bit of an experiment to see who will support who and if that means that we can just install a template in 2013 in Molajo and Nooku Server and Joomla 1.20 and all the other distributions that are probably going to get developed now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and if somehow you&rsquo;re hedged with your extension will somehow work in Molajo and work with this and work with that, and if you stick with Joomla, for example, Joomla 1.5 development and it works in these other things then you as an extension developer are hedged that it will work or it might need minor tweaks and so you&rsquo;ll be confident to develop in the one knowing it kind of will work in the others too and no matter where people gravitate to, they can still buy your product, they can buy your extension.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s the thinking behind it as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but from really a business perspective a lot of people in the Joomla community that have a Joomla business are also developers.&nbsp; Like PHP developers or template developers so they are entrepreneurs but also a developer so the way they see things tend to differ from someone that&rsquo;s only an entrepreneur, like me.&nbsp; But as a business, because you see that a few people are already saying, &ldquo;okay I have this product and it works in Nooku Server and in Molajo and in Joomla 1.5&Prime; and I think that&rsquo;s pretty cool.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t name a few examples but there are not a lot that do that, but from a business perspective you don&rsquo;t really have to because at the moment 99 percent of your revenue will come from Joomla and it&rsquo;s cool to say well it works in Nooku Server and it works for Molajo but in my case if I would communicate that on my website then 99 percent of my users would say, &ldquo;What? what is Molajo and what&rsquo;s Nooku Server?&rdquo;. Because most users have no idea that Joomla 1.7 will be out in, I believe, a month or two.&nbsp; So they even have a lesser idea of the existance of Molajo and Nooku Server, so as a business I believe there is no reason to support Molajo or Nooku Server right now it&rsquo;s probably just going to be if you like to do it for innovation reasons or other reasons, okay, but purely for revenue or for other business reasons there is no reason because there are not enough users, I believe, to warrant that decision. And also besides that both Molajo and Nooku are still alpha so I personally at the moment am not going to put a lot of energy in supporting those CMS&rsquo;s with all of my extensions because a) they are alpha and b) there won&rsquo;t be a lot of users using them at the moment.&nbsp; And if that changes and you see that 20, 40 percent of users still Joomla users but using Molajo or Nooku Server, then of course it&rsquo;s very interesting to start converting your extensions and making sure that they also work with the other distributions/CMS versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[For Nooku, I disagree. Two other frameworks are already built with Nooku &mdash; see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://anahitapolis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anahita web site\">Anahitapolis.com</a>, and Morph.

This is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Torkil Johnsen joins me today to talk about getting yourself up-and-running for Nooku Framework development. Coinciding with my &ldquo;Club Commerce&rdquo; launch, I will produce an ongoing series of shows about Nooku.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Torkil is personally sponsoring today&rsquo;s transcripts. His email to me was &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just happy to chip in&rdquo;, an impressive display of support for present and future Nooku peers. Just &ldquo;chipping in&rdquo; &mdash; indeed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s get down to a pressing question: Torkil, at the recent&nbsp;Joomla and Beyond Conference, did you prefer the ice cream or the beer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;The ice cream of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;The ice cream, so you were</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;David is a good friend of mine so I couldn&rsquo;t possibly say anything else on air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;What were your impressions of JAB11?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it was pretty much as I expected it would be.&nbsp; I attended JAB10 as well.&nbsp; What was nice was of course that more of the American crew took the time and the money, of course, to come over to Europe and I got to meet people from the Molajo camp like Christina and Amy and Matt and stuff and so it was really a bit more diverse nationality wise than it was last year.&nbsp; The venue was awesome and the organizers have done a really terrific job.&nbsp; The program was great, there were four different sessions going on at all time, I think, and the weather was excellent, some people took it upon themselves to sponsor parties two of the days.&nbsp; I think Johan and Nooku sponsored a party on the first day or it was the day before the first day actually, and eBay sponsored a barbecue and stuff on the second day, so yeah, we got off cheap. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I talked to on my round table show saying JAB11 the take away was Joomla is one big happy family, or one big family and JAB11 was like a family gathering.&nbsp; Do you think that&rsquo;s accurate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, no I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; A family gathering, yeah sure, but it&rsquo;s very European dominated.&nbsp; You have mostly people from Europe, Asian countries have a lot of Joomla users as well it&rsquo;s really big in like for instance Indonesia and of course there weren&rsquo;t too many Americans or people from Australia, so but it was a family gathering of course, yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I was thinking about Nooku, Joomla and Molajo as you know, the Joomla family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But it is interesting where people come from.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;m really going to have to really make a point to go next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;yeah, you should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m going to come with a t-shirt, a Canadian flag and it will say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from America&rdquo;. [laughter] but I&rsquo;m really close to the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;We make fun of Americans and those Americans who were there, they seem to pretty much handle it.&nbsp; So, but it&rsquo;s not your fault.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen Michael Morre&rsquo;s movies about the healthcare system and stuff and they go off to Canada to get some cheap medicine or people from Canada going South and they have to get expensive insurance and stuff, so I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re on the North side.&nbsp; Good for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well my politics is &ldquo;I love America and I love Americans,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m not getting into the healthcare debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Oh that&rsquo;s too bad.&nbsp; You should have seen the extra material on the DVD from Norway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Just on a personal note and I might put the picture up.&nbsp; My Dad&rsquo;s a Pharmacist, I went to his 50th Alumni Reunion last week.&nbsp; I was amongst a lot of healthcare professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people I talk to on my podcasts have their own freelancing or extension business. You are an exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;I am?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, you are.&nbsp; Tell us about where you work and what your job is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, I work for a Norwegian advertising company here in Bod&oslash;, Norway, it&rsquo;s up North.&nbsp; We do lots of different kinds of work &ndash; advertising of course &ndash; but we also produce physical signage and we produce prints for t-shirts or posters.&nbsp; Printwork and then we have part of the business that&rsquo;s web development as well, we do websites for customers and for a long time the company was kind of like an integrator business early on like 10 years ago they had their own CMS php based. And, gradually, after I came on board here we switched over to using Mambo at first, and then went onwards to Joomla from thereon.&nbsp; I like working here and living the Norwegian dream I suppose, it&rsquo;s 8-4 and then relax for the rest of the day and you get your five weeks paid vacation and 12 weeks of mandatory paternity leave and yeah, it&rsquo;s good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and you do have a young family and you have your hands full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, they can be handful. I have a 3-year-old son who is called Vemund, and a 4-month-old daughter called Una.&nbsp; A lovely wife of course, and I work.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, I think it&rsquo;s a good thing as well.&nbsp; You learn to prioritize better, at least I do &ndash; I prioritize my time a lot more than when I did when we didn&rsquo;t have kids, so yeah, I love it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, amongst all that going on and a 4-month-old you&rsquo;re very active with Nooku and doing the Wiki&rsquo;s and the Google Groups, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, yeah I try of course.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s kind of like the pay it forward idea from, you know, the movie where if one guy helps you then it&rsquo;s your obligation to help three other guys who come after you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a part of the community for a long time and it&rsquo;s just the mentality of it.&nbsp; When you get into it it feels natural.&nbsp; Someone comes on the mailing list and asks a question that you can answer, in my case a simple question of course, and if I can answer it I&rsquo;ll be happy to just chip in and help people out.&nbsp; Recently there&rsquo;s been a lot of activity on the mailing list and a lot of new developers have been coming on so there have been some questions regarding the tutorials and the wiki and stuff, so I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself and there are a few other guys who are helping out as well to improve first of all the &ldquo;Hello World: Tutorial to get people started and of course the most important part just getting Nooku Framework installed somewhere, preferably on your local drive so you can start working with it and see what all the fuss is about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Now com_harbour was set up as an example, as a sample and example and an introduction.&nbsp; Are people complaining on the Google Group that it has too many things in it and they need something simpler to look at? Or, am I reading the Google Group wrong?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;No, I don&rsquo;t think they are compaining but yeah, it&rsquo;s evolved you can say from.&nbsp; It was Christian who started, Christian Hent, he&rsquo;s a German guy, and he started it as a kind of a learning experience, I&rsquo;m going to teach myself Nooku Framework so I&rsquo;m going to create an example component and others can read my component when I&rsquo;m done and probably learn something from it.&nbsp; But of course it is with Christian as with all other Nooku people you never stop learning so his component has just evolved from a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; component to an example component to what I would say is more like a showcase component of all the different kinds of things you can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And he has to keep updating it every time the framework changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, Christian updates it and Stian would update it and Johan would pitch in and I remember when we would pitch in to keep it up and running and use it as a test case for new stuff that comes into the framework, so whenever new features would make it in and Christian would go on the mailing list, &ldquo;Yeah that sounds cool, I&rsquo;ll make something for com_harbour&rdquo;, and yeah he would do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;They should rename it com_lab instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but once you get into the basics it is really useful to check out what he&rsquo;s doing because it is a simple component with harbours and boats and captains and stuff like that, so the concept is really easy to grasp and so once you know the basics it&rsquo;s a very useful component and so are all other components for Nooku as well, like I read NinjaBoard codes often and now that com_ohana is out I have been checking that out too, I was in the beta group and I got sent installable packages every so often, I&rsquo;ve been checking out their code, and stealing some here and borrowing some there, so reading other peoples code is really really useful once you get over the initial hurdles so to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I&rsquo;m one of those initial hurdle guys and I love all the people from JAB11 who then signed onto the Google Group, I didn&rsquo;t feel so bad, but I realized I have a Joomla frame of mind and I didn&rsquo;t realize that that&rsquo;s good and that&rsquo;s bad and the first thing to do is to realize you&rsquo;re not quite in Joomla anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, well not quite, but yes and no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I blew it with com_harbour.&nbsp; I tried to build it and then realized it&rsquo;s, no I think I&rsquo;m supposed to do something else, but let&rsquo;s start a little from the top on how to set up a Nooku development environment, and not jump the gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;First of all we have to demystify a bit.&nbsp; We must remember that Nooku is built primarily by Johan, and earlier, on Mathias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I forgot, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;yeah but you must remember that Johan wrote most of 1.5 as well.&nbsp; So the framework allows you to write components that would work on Joomla and it uses many of the same concepts that are found in Joomla, only that the code has improved a lot.&nbsp; So, if you come from another CMS you have to start way way over where you are starting right now.&nbsp; You have to start by understanding what is a component, what is a &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah, I understand that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; you have a good starting point so don&rsquo;t despair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;No, I&rsquo;ve looked at Stian&rsquo;s NinjaBoard and I&rsquo;ve trashed sites because I deleted NinjaBoard or whatever but the plug-in koowa was still there and it was still active, enabled, and that caused the whole site to trash.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;ve been baptized just enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;[laughter] Baptism of fire, yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;yes, exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;but of course, okay where do you want to start?&nbsp; Should we take a 101 how to get your working environment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;A bit because I&rsquo;ve gone through all of the Wiki and everything and I thought the one thing there was no interaction podcast or video and I thought we should do something like that and I&rsquo;ve seen Johan in a lot of his presentations and thank you for recording them.&nbsp; The only interaction is the Q&amp;A at the end, so I thought we&rsquo;d get a little deeper.&nbsp; The first thing you need is Apache and PHP and MySQL set up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah and you could just grab an AMP Stack and that&rsquo;s really quick, easy and a free way to get started with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;With [W]AMPP, and just use the latest versions that it has?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, Nooku Framework was developed on PHP 5.2, if you use MAMP you can, like I have a MAC and I use MAMP all the time.&nbsp; So you can choose whether you want to run 5.2 or 5.3 but it should run just fine on 5.3 as well.&nbsp; Use WAMP, MAMP, LAMP, SAMP or whatever it&rsquo;s just a really easy way to get the package going and to get started on what you really want to work on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Does it matter what MySQL version you&rsquo;re using?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; I think a minimum requirement is 5.04 or 5.05 or something like that.&nbsp; It should say on the Wiki.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s 5.04 that is the minimum version required and you have to be able to run MySQLi as well &mdash; improved.&nbsp; Most components require that now I see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>And once Apache/MySQL/PHP are installed, are there extra PHP packages to install at the command line?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;No.&nbsp; You should be fine with the default set-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I ended up installing a subversion package, or version something, at the command line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, subversion is nice as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I knew I was lost at the command line. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Which operating system are you using?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I&rsquo;m on Windows and Windows Ancient and I was impressed how I typed whatever the command was and it looked for the PEAR package for that subversion, whatever it was, I won&rsquo;t even look at my notes to look up what it was.&nbsp; and I found it and it downloaded, did everything all at the command line, but I thought, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this, I must be doing something wrong&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;For Windows I know you can use some graphic user interfaces for SVN if you want to.&nbsp; If you install Eclipse you can install like Subeclipse for Eclipse and you can use SVN through Eclipse as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well that&rsquo;s why.&nbsp; I thought you know I should be in Eclipse.&nbsp; I know there&rsquo;s a lot of IDE&rsquo;s out there but we should take about Eclipse because that&rsquo;s the one people are most familiar with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;CRAPS?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not saying one should use it but it&rsquo;s a common reference point.&nbsp; What version of Eclipse should someone download?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Use the latest version I guess.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t get involved in that, I have used lots of different versions and I haven&rsquo;t had problems with either one of them.&nbsp; I update when I need to update.&nbsp; If you ask me, I really don&rsquo;t know what version of Eclipse I am running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>I should really rephrase.&nbsp; There are different [Eclipse] packages and people should install the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-php-developers/heliossr2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Eclipse for PHP Developer\">PHP Eclipse package</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah you could, of course.&nbsp; Eclipse has different flavours as well, so yeah of course you could use the PHP package as well.&nbsp; What I use the most for development is well the IDEs [Integrated Development Environment] has the advantage that you can look up classes and stuff really easily but you know the lighter code editors are catching up on those types of features as well.&nbsp; So stuff like Espresso and Coda won&rsquo;t get you very far as well.&nbsp; But Eclipse is an IDE, it can be a bit heavy for a beginner to get started with but if you want to use regular Eclipse or the PHP flavour then it should be fine either way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I was surprised at the question what IDE should I use after JAB11 in the Google Group and there was a lot of opinions, I thought, &ldquo;wow!&rdquo;.&nbsp; And also there&rsquo;s something called PHP Tools, it&rsquo;s an add-on once you install Eclipse you should&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, are you talking about PTI?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;PHP Tools integrated or whatever the I stands for, is a collection of tools like PHP Depend, PHP Unit and CodeSniffer as well, and one other extension I can&rsquo;t remember from the top of my head.&nbsp; But it integrates a lot of command line tools [which is why I shouldn&rsquo;t install these tools separately at the command line -Bob] with Eclipse so you can use them directly into Eclipse.&nbsp; PHP Depend for instance will show you metrics about your component, like how many levels of inheritance do you have, how many methods or functions do you run, whatever.&nbsp; So you can compare that to other components and other frameworks if you want to.&nbsp; But what I&rsquo;ve used the most is the CodeSniffer and the CodeSniffer is when you integrate it into Eclipse it will &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; your code, if you will, once you save your file for instance.&nbsp; So if you have a bad syntax somewhere if you are not doing it according to the sniffer rules then you will get a warning of some visual sort somewhere in your code so it can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well let&rsquo;s pursue that because you have to go to the Nooku Assembla Respository to get a file for CodeSniffer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, CodeSniffer is really a set of rules a sniff is one rule and a package of multiple rules can be called like a template for coding or rules or&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But you have to go to Nooku&rsquo;s Tool space to get the CodeSniffer files for Nooku, right?&nbsp; You have to bring that into Eclipse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, if you want to use the CodeSniffer then yeah but to be honest with you there Bob, I don&rsquo;t think anyone is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, see I&rsquo;m glad I had this show! [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;I did some work on the CodeSniffer and I took some of the existing PEAR has one set of rules for writing PEAR Extensions and ZEND has another and they are all multiple sniffs out there that you can use, so what I did was I took a basic set of rules and I modified it a bit so that the rule set would be a bit similar to the code that is in the Nooku Framework.&nbsp; So, yes you can use it as a rule set for writing code and what it will do is that it will make the code that person A is writing look identical to the code that person B is writing, it is a rule set for how the code should look, really.&nbsp; And you can use it of course for tracking bugs and discovering if someone is using legacy code that they shouldn&rsquo;t be deprecated functions and that kind of thing as well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that if you were supposed to get started with Nooku Framework then code sniffing shouldn&rsquo;t be your primary concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And I think another PTI tool is XD Bug, is that something that must be downloaded right away?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t seen that in PTI to be honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;But XD Bug of course you don&rsquo;t need to use php tools integration to use XD Bug.&nbsp; There has been a lot of discussion around XD Bug on the mailing list recently hasn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp; You are reading the interesting stuff and I am helping out the newbies!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m reading all of it, you know the topics. It&rsquo;s not a salient topic for the last two weeks.&nbsp; I think maybe before all the JAB11 people came on, it&rsquo;s interesting.&nbsp; But something that someone has to install on Eclipse is Subeclipse or Subclips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Subclips, yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Otherwise they can&rsquo;t talk to the Nooku Subversion Repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you need it to use as beyond inside Eclipse basically.&nbsp; So, are we going to get down and dirty and try to set this up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I&rsquo;m trying to [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Are you actually doing it while we&rsquo;re talking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, forget that.&nbsp; That would never work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to get a sense of all the things someone has to install first in Eclipse.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not just you download Eclipse, the PHP version and there it is.&nbsp; You have to have Subeclipse, if you want you could do XD Bug, if you want you can do Code Sniffer, but something else is Phing, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you can use Phing as well.&nbsp; But to be honest the packages for Phing hasn&rsquo;t been updated recently.&nbsp; Like for com_harbour if you try to run the Phing script on that I don&rsquo;t think it will work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So it&rsquo;s not me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;No, let&rsquo;s just strip down all the tools and talk about what really needs to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, well that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.&nbsp; I feel very excited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s just strip it down to the bare minimums and say you need Eclipse and if you don&rsquo;t want to do SVN and the command line you should probably install Subeclipse as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Look, you have to have it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you need it to check out the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an easy one.&nbsp; The other thing is, do you want to talk about<strong>&nbsp;</strong>symlinking now or wait a minute?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;No, we can do Phing and symlinking right away.&nbsp; Phing is a great build tool.&nbsp; So if you are building a component, you are doing continuous integration and stuff like that then Phing is a really great tool because it allows you to write xmount files that allows you to build an installable package of your component.&nbsp; So you can go very fast from having a directory structure of files and folders where your code is and your install file and you can run the Phing script on it and get an installable package that you can send to, for instance, Bob Bloom and he can run it through his Joomla installer and your component will be up and running.&nbsp; So you can use it to automate some tedious tasks if you look.&nbsp; So, it&rsquo;s a really useful tool for people like Stien who is regularly building new versions of NinjaBoard and distributing it.&nbsp; So, yeah, it&rsquo;s a great tool but symlinking is something that you use a lot more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re developing something you shouldn&rsquo;t, like com_harbour, you really shouldn&rsquo;t put that in the regular Eclipse space, you should have a separate space for com_harbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you could do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This is the impression I get from reading everything because com_harbour&nbsp; changes and you want to be able to change it on your local development environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And if you put it in the same Eclipse workspace you won&rsquo;t be able to do an automation of that update</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Well, whether or not you want to automate the update it really comes down to what you&rsquo;re trying to do.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re trying to build a project like I do regularly, I build projects for clients and I use Nooku Framework even though it&rsquo;s in Alpha stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Everybody&rsquo;s using it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even think Alpha is&hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t matter when you&rsquo;re seeing all the extensions coming out and using it anyways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;So, what I would do is I would get a stable version like Alpha 2 and I would just stick to it and use it all the time and not upgrade Nooku Framework.&nbsp; When I am playing around and writing other kinds of code I will update Nooku Framkework like daily and I will update my own code to reflect the changes that have happened to the framework as well.&nbsp; So, then the com_harbour of course updates regularly with the framework as well so I think it would be advised to do an SVM checkout of com_harbour and Nooku Framework and just keep them up to date and whenever com_harbour updates then you update your framework to the corresponding version if you want to check out the new stuff that&rsquo;s happening in com_harbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So, what is symlinking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Symlinking is just creating a file that&rsquo;s a reference to another point in your file system.&nbsp; So a symlink can be a link to another directory or another file, for instance.&nbsp; So this becomes useful when you are trying to set up, let&rsquo;s say, a local host southlasallemedia with com_harbour.&nbsp; A Joomla installation or a Nooku Server installation, Joomla 1.5 or 1.6, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; What you would have is you&rsquo;d have the CMS in one folder, right? and then you&rsquo;d use SVM to check out com_harbour in another folder, perhaps on the same [folder] level.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;d have your root folder where you&rsquo;d access Joomla like the index.php file for Joomla and you&rsquo;d have on the same level you&rsquo;d have a folder for com_harbour and the com_harbour check out that you would do would contain of course directories like &ldquo;administrator&rdquo; and &ldquo;languages&rdquo; and &ldquo;modules&rdquo; and all the stuff like that.&nbsp; So to get com_harbour up and running on your Joomla installation without installing it through the Joomla installer, you would have to effectively copy all these files to their corresponding folders inside the Joomla installation.&nbsp; So inside administrator components you&rsquo;d have to copy the com_harbour folder.&nbsp; Inside the component folder you&rsquo;d have to copy the com_harbour folder.&nbsp; And this becomes very tedious of course if you haven&rsquo;t got a script to automate the whole thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what we do with symlinking is we take the com_harbour folder structure and we run that through a symlinker script so that inside your Joomla installation symlinks are placed that point back to the com_harbour folders.&nbsp; So inside your Joomla installation, inside the administrator components you would find a com_harbour symlink that would point to the corresponding folder in the SVM checkout that you did.&nbsp; Does this make sense?&nbsp; What this allows you to do is that you can have a Joomla installation, you can have a com_harbour and you can have a Nooku Framework checkout that is on the same level in your file system.&nbsp; Like you&rsquo;d have three folders a Joomla, a com_harbour and Nooku Framework and they would live independently of one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;com_harbour is sitting somewhere other than your Joomla install.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And Nooku Framework is sitting somewhere other than your Joomla install, but on the site you&rsquo;re working on the symlink says I know where those components are, and the Joomla site works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Precisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But on your local file structure they are in different directories than they would normally be on your install.&nbsp; One reason is you can have the Nooku Framework in one spot and use it for multiple projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, good example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And com_harbour is again you can update that separately whenever you update it or Christian updates it, then you can do another check out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, what happens is that you have an SVN repository that you have checked out.&nbsp; You have com_harbour lying in one folder and once you do a SVN check out then maybe 10 or 20 files have changed, the symlinks stay the same so they just point to the new files, there is no need to do another install or whatever.&nbsp; If the database structure is the same then there is just minor file changes which is normal in the case then you just do a check out then voila your component is updated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and to implement this, do you need to download something else in Eclipse?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;No, you don&rsquo;t need to download something in Eclipse.&nbsp; We have a tool in the Tools space on Nooku&rsquo;s Assembla site where we have a little thing called a symlinker and there are different versions of the symlinker, there are both files for Windows and for Unix operating systems and there is also a Python version of it if you want to do that.&nbsp; So what it does, is that you would run the symlinker with two parameters.&nbsp; The first parameter would be the folder that com_harbour is in and the second parameter would be the folder your Joomla installation is in.&nbsp; So what the symlinker would do is that it would iterate through all the contents in the com_harbour and it would set up symlinks inside your Joomla install to those folders or files.&nbsp; So you run one command and you get probably ten symlinks for the component, for the back end component, for the language files, for the modules and for the media folders and probably some other things too &ndash; depending on what kind of component it is.&nbsp; But the symlinker basically just does an install for you without doing the database whereas unfortunately you have to do those manually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I find the Symlinker is the one that I end up getting hung up on and once I conquer it, I think the whole world of Nooku&rsquo;s going to open up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, how can I help?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, no no no no.&nbsp; Just going through.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s one of those pressure points because I&rsquo;m always thinking of, you know I&rsquo;m in Joomla and there&rsquo;s com_harbour so I&rsquo;ve got to take the install package and install it.&nbsp; With symlinker it&rsquo;s just better to use the symlinker.&nbsp; But, to get that in actually working now in Joomla you have to manually install the database inserts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you have to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So how does that work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;The installation of com_harbour has an SQL file in it, so you can run the SQL from your comline or you can just copy/paste the entire contents of it into phpMyAdmin, which if you install MAMP [http://localhost/phpmyadmin -Bob] you would get phpMyAdmin in that package as well and once MAMP is installed and you start up MAMP then the opening page for MAMP will have a link to phpMyAdmin and you can just go directly to the SQL part of phpMyAdmin and just run the queries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Right.&nbsp; PHP My Admin, yeah, it&rsquo;s an import.&nbsp; You just import the SQL file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp; And one thing you might have to do before that is you might have to replace the database prefix with your own database prefix before you run the queries.&nbsp; You do a search/replace for &ldquo;#__&rdquo; [that&rsquo;s a double &lsquo;_&rsquo; -Bob] and replace it with whatever your DB prefix is like jos_ for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.&nbsp; [laughing] do you know I always miss that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;[laughing] yeah, well PHP My Admin is really friendly and will tell you that &ldquo;Bob you screwed up&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re impatient again, you&rsquo;ve got to search and replace the ampersand or the tic-tac-toe symbol&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp; So it is that, but you know it is an alpha project so it seems like this is lots of hoops to run through to get you up and running but in the end to me,&nbsp;<strong>it&rsquo;s really worth it because you can use your newfound knowledge to your own benefit when you are creating your own components and doing client work</strong>&nbsp;[yes, powerful tools for work with my clients! -Bob].&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s really useful stuff to learn PHING and symlinking and setting up Eclipse and stuff like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I don&rsquo;t really find it like a lot of hoops, it&rsquo;s only when it doesn&rsquo;t work and knowing that right now I don&rsquo;t have to worry about XDbug, maybe I don&rsquo;t have to worry about Code Sniffer right away.&nbsp; The pressure points are, of course, get subversion working and Eclipse and then get the symlinking working.&nbsp; And then once that&rsquo;s done, you know, you can delve into the other stuff.&nbsp; But this is the way to get it working, the symlink I think is, you have to get that working and nothing else really matters until you get that set up and I&rsquo;ll be taking notes with the ambition that you know, I&rsquo;ll contribute to how to do that.&nbsp; My fingers are crossed when I say that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Well documentation can always get better if you get some good questions in there.&nbsp; So, if you or other people on your various operating systems who try to run the symlinker and try to do what the documentation says and you can&rsquo;t get it done then perhaps the documentation needs updating and I&rsquo;d be happy to oblige in my spare time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, in your plentiful spare time and thank you for the offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Oh but it&rsquo;s fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It could be, I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Ah, helping out in the community and meeting lots of friendly people and helping people out is really a good way to get to know people too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, on that I&rsquo;m going to go further.&nbsp; I think the culture is spectacular on the Nooku Google Group.&nbsp; A new batch of developers signed up and they&rsquo;re asking questions and everybody is being very patient and it&rsquo;s like a new iteration of updating the wiki and updating the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; [component] and all that and it&rsquo;s spectacular.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lot of patience, it&rsquo;s a mentoring culture and it&rsquo;s leadership.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re showing all these new people what it&rsquo;s about and then they&rsquo;ll be the next sort of generation when JAB12 comes out they&rsquo;ll be the ones holding the hands of all the new people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you know actually I said that to another guy (sorry for interrupting) but I said exactly that to another guy on the email last night.&nbsp; He was saying thanks for updating the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; example and helping him through some problems he had with his code.&nbsp; He had gotten the symlinking done and he was down to writing code so he was thanking me for helping him out and I just said to him that &ldquo;okay, just remember this and you help out the next three guys that come along&rdquo;.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s a lot of the mentality in here, it is developer friendly.&nbsp; If you go on the mailing list you will see that almost all the discussions in there are about writing code.&nbsp; If you attend the Google chat as well which has a bit thinner audience of more experienced guys perhaps, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s not as many as on the mailing list of course.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s also strictly code only chat and just a few days ago we were discussing &ldquo;okay, what should we do with the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; example to update it to the present standards and stuff&rdquo; and we were writing emails back and forth between one and another and had to organize this tutorial and then Johan suddenly jumps in and he says &ldquo;okay guys enough talk, let&rsquo;s code&rdquo;.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s a lot of the mentality as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;The only sort of criticism Johan&rsquo;s put in the [Nooku] Google Group is &ldquo;can you please have one thread per question&rdquo;, but otherwise he&rsquo;s been in there like anyone else, guiding everybody and it&rsquo;s impressive.&nbsp; I find it&rsquo;s very impressive, just like you want to chip in for the transcripts so that people can read along and I can put in links and stuff.&nbsp; I think the entire thing is impressive &ndash; so there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;I like it very much too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m really happy to be a part of it and as you say, it is kind of like a mentality so once you get in there you won&rsquo;t&nbsp; think twice about helping other people out yourself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just, it grows on you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it, it&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well it&rsquo;s funny, with com_harbour Phing didn&rsquo;t work because you know I have to run the build so I can install it in Joomla &ndash; right? Which it&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; So I looked at the code in Phing and not having ever touched it said &ldquo;oh no no, I don&rsquo;t need it to go to the repository to get koowa, so I started deleting.&nbsp; I thought &ldquo;boy if this works I&rsquo;ll just offer it to the group&rdquo;, so you just end up getting in there anyways, and start giving back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Actually I did check it out during our conversation here and I think the Phing script hasn&rsquo;t been updated since 2010 so perhaps I should give Christian a nudge and perhaps he will update it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That is not what I&rsquo;m thinking at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Or maybe he&rsquo;ll just delete it so no one else will go down that blind alley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;No, leave it in there and don&rsquo;t worry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The funny thing is it&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re developing the component, you think of com_harbour as your very own component you&rsquo;re developing for your client and you don&rsquo;t develop it by putting it into a Joomla install.&nbsp; You leave it separate, you symlink it and then you link it to your own SVN and that&rsquo;s the way it goes.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it allows you to&nbsp;<em>keep your own code bases separate from the code base of Joomla</em>.&nbsp; So once you have completed your com_harbour version 1.0 beta, whatever, and you want to distribute it to the whole world then you have your code in a separate code base and it&rsquo;s easy for you to package it.&nbsp; Compared to if you start building com_harbour inside a Joomla install and you have to create a Phing script or something to pick out the correct folders to put in an installable package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right and you&rsquo;re going to realize you need two builds.&nbsp; You need one with the framework and you need one without.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, or you can just say to your clients, &ldquo;hey you need to install Joomla and you&nbsp; need to install the Nooku Framework first&rdquo;.&nbsp; But a lot of components out there are distributing the Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;No, I&rsquo;m going to disagree with you on that.&nbsp; Because if they have Ninjaboard or there&rsquo;s more things coming out, they cannot install, you cannot put Nooku Framkework in your build.&nbsp; They have to do the nonbuild or the non framework build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m getting hung up on my terminology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, like Ninjaboard and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://app.ohanah.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ohanah, Joomla events extension\">Ohana</a>, I think Ohana does distribute the framework with their installation, it&rsquo;s the user friendly thing to do.&nbsp; You just want your users to download the zip and dump it into the install and it will fix itself no matter what, if you have the framework or not. [See<a href=\"https://www.akeebabackup.com/download/official/akeeba-subscriptions.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Akeeba Subscriptions Download Page\">&nbsp;Akeeba Subscriptions Download page</a>&nbsp;for an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about &mdash; click &ldquo;View Files&rdquo;, 1.0.b2(Beta) is latest at time of this podcast -Bob].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen.&nbsp; I have a real bee in my bonnet about that and I know I talked to the Round Table guys about that.&nbsp; But Phing is not something that&rsquo;s absolutely needed when you&rsquo;re first setting up the development environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;No, I think history has shown and confused you a bit more than it will help you as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So when you&rsquo;re first setting up your Nooku development environment, there&rsquo;s the LAMP, MAMP, WAMP there&rsquo;s Eclipse or whatever you&rsquo;re using, you have to have Subversion add-on so you can talk to the repository and you have to have symlinker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it makes the job easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and then get com_harbour or whatever and get comfortable and then from there you can expand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a good choice.&nbsp; And now that we seen in the coming weeks we will probably improve the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; tutorial as well and it will be kind of like how to build a com_blog from scratch.&nbsp; So you would start by creating folders for com_blog in your administrator and your components and you would start creating files and doing everything from scratch.&nbsp; Whereas com_harbour is &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This is very sneaky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;com_harbour is a showcase example of a bigger kind of thing.&nbsp; So if you want to start out with something that&rsquo;s easier, that&rsquo;s our intention with the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; tutorial and the Wiki that we have been working on.&nbsp; So I think for now we have just done two steps and I think step one was just getting up and running and step two was creating some folders and get some output on the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;com_blog is probably going to end up in the framework in six or nine months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Aw we&rsquo;ll see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a way to sort of kick start an idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah let&rsquo;s try this&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll limit the topics we get into on the Wiki, we&rsquo;ll try to keep it sweet, short and simple.&nbsp; Because I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a problem, but for newcomers that&rsquo;s a problem with com_harbour.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s gotten big.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You know, I&rsquo;ve been mulling in my head about the Wiki because you have one Wiki per space in Assembla and I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;I think we need something comprehensive that&rsquo;s searchable&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m losing myself in the different spaces.&nbsp; So one day I&rsquo;m just going to pop up in the Google Group and then you&rsquo;ll see me there forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;It sounds like you&rsquo;ve been there for awhile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah, I follow it religiously.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just biding my time.&nbsp; But I thought this would be a way of doing it different to help everybody get a handle on getting started.&nbsp; I want to do more podcasts and then eventually, with my fingers crossed, move into screen casting on these concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah?&nbsp; I have been following your show for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard all 35 of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Almost 60 of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Oh 60 now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;In the year and a half, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;I have listened to quite a few, yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s fun to, well you don&rsquo;t see peoples faces but you can hear their voices and that kind of gives you a bit more of an impression than what just reading what they write will do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Actually, Alan Langford who leads&nbsp;<a href=\"http://toronto.joomla.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Joomla Users Group Toronto\">Toronto Joomla Group</a>, he&rsquo;s been on my shows before, so you&rsquo;ve heard of him.&nbsp; He has a new site called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://venturemedia.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Entrepreneurial Life\">VentureMedia.ca</a>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s doing video interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;All right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So, he&rsquo;s sort of my laboratory for that and it&rsquo;s more intensive than the podcasts.&nbsp; But I think the video&rsquo;s coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;I look forward to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Just the post production is unbelievable!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I suppose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and the other person on the other end also has to have the video and it&rsquo;s an incredible enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torkil:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for inviting me.&nbsp; It was a new experience for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh well, the pleasure&rsquo;s been all mine and thank you, Torkil Johnsen, for generously sponsoring today&rsquo;s transcripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(40, 76, 3, 'Tbbs36', '<p>Welcome to episode 36 of my &ldquo;Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom, from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Monday September 12th, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&nbsp; marks the start of at least bi-weekly podcasts during the fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all the nearly 60 podcasts I&rsquo;ve produced since February 2010, this podcast is the most difficult I&rsquo;ve put together. With a mountain of notes and over 50 takes, I know I have too much on my mind about my new Club Commerce. Why am I forming a Club of Clients, how am I going to run it, what are my objectives for you and me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing Virtuemart consulting for five odd years. Three-quarters of my clients were fellow consultants; and, one-quarter were site owners bootstrapping their own sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With such unusual difficulty putting this podcast together, I&rsquo;ve concluded that the best way for me to approach this podcast is to just speak from the heart, as a consultant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My marketing may not be the greatest, my copywriting not the slickest, but so what? I&rsquo;m going to help you make a ton of money with Tienda. Who needs slick? Let me just lay it out for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am forming a Club of Clients, which I am calling &ldquo;Club Commerce&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be a 300 Members, each paying a nominal-by-design $23.25CAD /month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve laid a lot of groundwork and now it&rsquo;s time for you to join. There are three Club websites, each finished:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:square\">\r\n	<li>Joomla site for site registrations &amp; downloads;</li>\r\n	<li>Anahita site for Discussion Groups;</li>\r\n	<li>Joomla site devoted to your Live Update requests.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Club software:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:square\">\r\n	<li>Tienda Distro;</li>\r\n	<li>Joomla installable Canadian Tax component;</li>\r\n	<li>Joomla installable&nbsp;Distro Control Center component, written with the Nooku Framework, mostly done;</li>\r\n	<li>Joomla installable California Tax component, halfway done.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There are seven Founding Members, plus me. A fabulous group, you&rsquo;ll be keeping good company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla Clubs have thousands and tens of thousands of subscribers. My Club is different, with just 300 Members. 293 Memberships available, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After five-odd years doing Virtuemart consulting, I am focusing on Tienda. How I got from there to here is worthy of a separate podcast, but talking about here will get us sidetracked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why am I consulting differently with Tienda than I did with Virtuemart?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, why am I asking my clients to do one thing differently with Tienda than we did with Virtuemart?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason is to help you make money, especially in these tough times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are not flush times. It&rsquo;s a very difficult environment. Clients are putting more pressure on their consultants. Site owners have a finite amount of investible funds to start and maintain their sites. Achieving that first online order; and, growing sales, is critical, as site owners rely on current revenues to fund their&nbsp; consultants&rsquo; invoices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can take a client&rsquo;s finite investible funds to their first online order, you have an edge. And I want you to have that edge with Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, my Club Commerce is still consulting. There&rsquo;s software, which is critical. But I&rsquo;m not selling software through subscriptions. What I am doing is offering a certain type of consulting at a fixed monthly fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why I am only accepting 300 Members. My consulting is not an open-ended thing. I can only accomodate so many people, and at 300, I am stretching things as it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to stretch the number of Clients in order to accumulate lots and lots of experiences with Tienda, so that we can uncover and fix real-life problems. We want to ferret out problems with different hosts, components, and templates, and get those experiences into the Tienda&rsquo;s code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to stretch the number of Clients in order to drive down your fixed monthly cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to stretch the number of Clients so we have a powerful critical mass of potential cost sharing opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With my Virtuemart work, everything I did was a one-off. When I fixed something for one client, I would send out the invoice and tuck that fix away. When the problem cropped up again with another client, I would install the fix and email the invoice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a totally different story with Tienda: I fix something for one client,&nbsp;<em>all my clients get that fix</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients agree to share the fixes I do for them in exchange for getting the fixes I do for my other clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a totally different story with Tienda: my clients lower their operational risk, merely by sharing their fixes and experiences with my other clients. As we resolve problems over the normal course of using Tienda, all my clients enjoy a smoothed-out version of Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real-life example: I installed RocketTheme&rsquo;s&nbsp; August 2011 &ldquo;Camber&rdquo; template for a Founding Member. Tienda&rsquo;s default category layout crapped out on Camber. I created an alternate category layout that played nicely with Camber. When I finished, I added my new Tienda layout to my Distro so that all my clients get that goodie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to discover these problems is to use Tienda in a lot of different environments. As much as it is tempting to find the 20 or 30 most bad-ass clients to invite into my Club Commerce, charge &lsquo;em upwards of $300/month, we would end up not discovering a heap of real-life issues. Having a handful of Members means not reducing operational risk enough for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I find a fix. How do I get it to you? Having me install each fix on each individual site? Having you do it? No, this is not practical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a private Club Tienda Distro for Members. It&rsquo;s done. It exists. It has Live Update. And it works. I downloaded Tienda, added some things, and put in Live Update. I built a new site to accomodate your Live Update remote requests, and ooooh it&rsquo;s beautiful. Instead of installing the original Tienda, Club Members will install my Club Distro instead. To upgrade it, you just go to your Joomla Administrator and fetch the update within Tienda&rsquo;s admin with a few clicks. Bada-bing, bada-boom, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see how it&rsquo;s shaping up. A Member complains about an intractable Tienda problem in a post-midnight Discussion Rant. Hey, it&rsquo;s real life here at Club Commerce. We Skype the next day as I can&rsquo;t make heads or tails of the rant. A three day adventure commences, hunting down the problem. We get the fix, I get that fix in our Distro, I send out a MailChimp alert and you get that fix faster than I can say &ldquo;Maple Leafs win the Stanley Cup&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Distro of ours, it&rsquo;s all Tienda, it&rsquo;s all there. When a new Tienda version comes out, I merge all our fixes and stuff into Tienda&rsquo;s new version. If Tienda includes fixes we donated, then we need not merge those fixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You always have the latest Tienda. In fact, you&rsquo;ll have all of the fixes that Tienda issues, because I will put &lsquo;em all in our Distro. You get it all. You get the official Tienda, you get the official Tienda fixes, and you get all the fixes your fellow Members discover and resolve. You get the nuggets we put in over the course of our working with Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like what kind of nugget. Like a customized site registration process. Actually, I did not genericize this enough to put in my Distro, we were so pressed for time. But I have the code I did do, and if &amp; when the issue comes up again, we&rsquo;ll genericize the code so that every Member has custom registration workflow. How&rsquo;s that for a real-life nugget, at no extra charge, in your back pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Distro makes you powerful. You get fixes, patches, and features immediately. The Tienda Project can take as long as it needs to take to include our donated code to their core, because you are covered. See, you don&rsquo;t make money waiting for a feature to get in the official Tienda that we have finished. And, you don&rsquo;t save money waiting for a fix we figured out or available as a patch to get into the official Tienda. Now, you get all the latest hot Tienda technology immediately, because I have a mechanism to get it to you. &ldquo;Distro&rdquo; means &ldquo;distribution&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I do:&nbsp; I distribute the code to you. That&rsquo;s what my clients want and get at maximum power via my Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what else my Club can do for you? Smooth out the localizations for you. Taxes can be a pain. The zones can be a pain. For Canadians, I have version 1.0 of HST/PST/GST done for Tienda. You install the Club Distro, then the Canadian Tax component, both in the Joomla installer. And that&rsquo;s it. California taxes, with it&rsquo;s nearly 1,800 municipal taxes, is halfway done. With these two tax localizations done, creating Tienda tax components&nbsp; for your tax jurisdiction should be relatively easy. Although maybe not for Europe &mdash; we&rsquo;ll cross that bridge when we get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BTW, all Club software is GPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my clients, and your fellow Club Members resolve their localization issues, we&rsquo;ll have more localization packages that you can install. So you are not faced with a blank Tienda on fresh sites. Instead, we&rsquo;ll be building one-click installs as we go along&nbsp; for different shipping and payment scenarios that will save you a ton of work and agony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am in the midst of finishing version one of my Club&rsquo;s Distro Command Centre component, written with the Nooku Framework. This component will report on the status of Tienda and all Club extensions we build. This component will contain tools and utilities that we build, such as the shipping and payment scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we have now are places to put the Tienda goodness we are building in my Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three hundred Members is my estimate of the furthest extent I can retain a real client-consultant relationship with each Member before losing the humanity I am striving to retain. I want to know my Members. To get to know you, to understand your sites.&nbsp; Mine is not a Club of anonymous people. You are my client, in my Club of Clients. My&nbsp; devotion and loyalty is to you &mdash; my client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are my client. Not some anonymous subscriber popping up in my monthly accounting spreadsheet. You are real. And that extends to my Club&rsquo;s Discussion Site. I personally participate in discussions, so you&rsquo;ll hear from me. And from your fellow Members too. There&rsquo;s human interaction, and respect.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what happens with a small group where people stick around month after month. It means that when you have a problem, we already have background and context with which to help you. The gang chimes in, I chime in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re stuck, it&rsquo;s past midnight, month-end billing is around the corner &mdash; yeah, we&rsquo;ve been there &mdash; then open a discussion topic on my Club&rsquo;s Anahita site, and give us the gist. When I crawl to the computer in the a.m. I will see your S.O.S., and you&rsquo;ll hear from me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m doing something else I&rsquo;ve never done in my Virtuemart days: I&rsquo;m jotting down&nbsp; the little tips and nuggets I learn as I go along with Tienda. If it&rsquo;s past midnight and you are bogged down in some corner of Tienda, maybe I wrote something about it that can get you over the hump.&nbsp; Adding tips and nuggets, and not always about Tienda, is part of delivering&nbsp; my base consulting service to you at a fixed nominal monthly fee. By sharing knowledge, by sharing issues your fellow Members are wrestling with, you are more powerful with Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For $23.25CAD/month, you are getting a lot of base consulting. You are getting my Club&rsquo;s Distro, Tax localization components, and Distro Command Centre component. You are getting knowledge that I am passing on to you in my Anahita Discussion site, in the hope that it saves you time and frustration. You are getting access to me and to your fellow Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For $23.25CAD/month, you are getting consulting access to me, which might be handy when you&rsquo;re in a spot. I do not plan on consulting for those outside my Club &mdash; I think 300 clients is plenty! Better that you have access to Club resources by joining now, then having a need but unable to access my Club later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am literally organizing my consulting to save you from spending thousands and tens of thousands of dollars on consultants and sub-contractors over the course of a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your $23.25CAD/month allows me to work on Tienda full-time for you. Released from per-hour billing, I am unleashed to bring as much Tienda technology to your sites as possible. I am unleashed to participate in my Discussion Groups. I am unleashed to work on new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know people ask: what do I get for $23.25CAD/month. I think of the monthly fee as a fixed nominal cost that gives you entree into earning money you might not have otherwise made. Or, saves you money you would otherwise have to spend. Or, that opens up&nbsp; Tienda as a Line of Business for you. Or, is a pipeline to a technical edge that you&rsquo;d otherwise not enjoy. Or, that saves you from spending time you do not have by getting you&nbsp; over the hump with a technical obstacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Club is limited membership. Other Joomla Clubs have thousands and tens of thousands of subscribers. My Club Commerce is a mere 300 Members. So don&rsquo;t wait to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have seven Founding Members on their second month paying the nominal $23.25 CAD/month. They are a phenomenal bunch, you will be keeping very good company. We have a regular Joomla Project contributor, two programmers, consultants with deep Joomla knowledge, and a small portfolio of live Tienda sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Founding Members have a lot to give. Including the potential to contribute cold cash to hot new features. The idea of cost sharing is not a mere pipe dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>293 more Members like the stellar group of Founding Members&nbsp; &mdash; well, I&rsquo;ll tell you: what couldn&rsquo;t we accomplish?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How gratifying it is for me to be contributing so significantly to the success of such a phenomenal group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this tough economic environment, I&rsquo;ve figured out a way to give my clients the technological basis and support mechanism at nominal cost with which to make make money</p>\r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to end here, despite staring at a mountain of notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Club is the real deal.

(41, 78, 3, 'Tbbs38', '<p><strong>Bob (Opening):</strong>&nbsp;Welcome to episode 38 of The Bob Bloom Show. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, September 15h, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arash Sanieyan and Rastin Mehr, Core Architects of The Anahita&trade; Open source Social Networking Software, join me to delve into Anahita. This is part two of our two part discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website is Anahitapolis.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcripts of this podcast are graciously sponsored by Anahita&trade;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;We left part one of the discussion talking about Anahita bursting out of its current distro and talking about moving to the Nooku Server when it comes out. I&rsquo;ve been thinking as we&rsquo;ve been looking at the discussions that maybe you&rsquo;re trying to replicate things that they&rsquo;re going to do on the Nooku Server or that should be part of a separate library and I keep coming back to the widgets because is it part of the framework, is it part of a template? What do you think?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re talking about Widgets?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s just a small UI thing. Let me, we constantly&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You talk like a true developer. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well that&rsquo;s what I am. But I mean we have about 20,000 lines of code and widget I think is about 3 lines of code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Is it really?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. It&rsquo;s really insignificant in that sense. But a lot of things we do we constantly keep especially in the branch task that we are working on for the next version, I keep up to date with Nooku. A lot of things Nooku does I look at what they&rsquo;ve done, if they have done something that we can reuse I will just use those. If it&rsquo;s something that they have and I need to extend it for our own framework I do that. So the direction is usually, I look at the things they have and see if the things that we do either use it directly or extend it or taking expressiosn from it and do it in our own context. Of course if Nooku folks if ever they want to look at Anahita and take some of the things on their own they&rsquo;re more than welcome to &ndash; we&rsquo;re here to help. But at this moment that&rsquo;s how we work. So when we look at and that&rsquo;s regardless of Nooku Server, I mean we still do the Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;There is nothing that, we&rsquo;re not duplicating anything that is Nooku Server. We basically, Anahita provides what No0ku doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; for ourselves&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip;which is sort of because Nooku Server is supposed to be a generic web platform and they&rsquo;ve done a great job by the way, it&rsquo;s less than half the size of Joomla, and Anahita is going to be specifically for building social networking technologies so things that you need do not exist in Nooku Framework and so we had to build those ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I mentioned in our first segment that I was shocked at how sparse your components are, or your apps are, compared to the framework. I was actually worried, are you putting too much component-y things into the framework?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re not. We put reusable patterns into our framework and that&rsquo;s what the framework is. It&rsquo;s basically, the idea is that you look at how you build things and you take the parts that are reusable and you put them as a framework or library and you ship them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can tell you something, when somebody goes and looks at Anahita they see different apps: they see Photo App, they see Discussion App, they see a To-Do app.&nbsp;<strong>But really we only have three types of apps. We have apps that are like groups and people or events, we call them ACTOR type apps which is sort of like acts as a container of people. We have apps that act as MEDIUM apps like to do Photo Discussion, they are very similar in nature</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;They are content creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;They are content creation and publishing app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;We have apps that don&rsquo;t follow the first two steps, the first two categories and those are like Connect, Invite or other things that don&rsquo;t necessarily have the same structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;They integrate with external services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;No they are just not following the same, they&rsquo;re just different, they&rsquo;re just regular apps.&nbsp;<strong>They don&rsquo;t follow any, either they&rsquo;re not a container app or publishing app they just do other things.</strong>&nbsp;So, the first two categories, a lot of part of them are reusable. We take those parts and put them in the framework. Why? Because that way we can generate different apps, create different apps for different context but the core foundation of the apps are similar within themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That is the whole concept to DRY &ndash; Do Not Repeat Yourself &ndash; our code is very DRY. You don&rsquo;t want extra moisture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s DRY and SasSy {sometimes, programming puns are not really that funny when you proof the transcription afterwards &ndash; Bob}.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and if you have specific type of content that I guess would need tables on the database, that would be something you would do an app for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I think we missed that last sentence. Could you repeat that again please?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;The content creation apps, they have extra database tables and so you, I guess my question was really trailing off anyways {oops! -Bob}.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to get into also your actual community. Because it&rsquo;s another culture shock for me. When I started 5-6 years ago with the free open source and freelancing on my own, I just got a lot of attitude that you know, this is free software, I develop it I give it to you, I really don&rsquo;t have to, I don&rsquo;t have to really answer your questions or I could adopt a certain attitude about it and I&rsquo;ve talked a lot to David and Nicholas about this and about support. Belonging to your site, I think I can be a little irritable or suggest things and you never say to me, you know, the framework is free just figure it out or something like that. I want to commend you for building the community, the human part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I think in our business, or in our sort of project, community involvement is as important as software development&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; more important [laughter] and I&rsquo;m the technology guy&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; Ash is officially the Chief Technology Officer&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but I&rsquo;m actually saying the human aspect of it is more important than technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;You build software and community side by side and you sort of build the software, give it to the community, they use it or development on it and you sort of observe and get a response back and you build again and this cycle continues. Which is one reason that social web and GPL go hand in hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; border: 1px solid rgb(108, 182, 86); padding: 5px;\">\r\n<p>So, for us it was critical to get the community right and Anahitopolis is a very sort of young community. But we sort of followed very simple principals, the most important one was&nbsp;<strong>focus on those who care</strong>&nbsp;and filter out those who are not as much interested and so that helped a lot and yes that goes against the traditional marketing or business that they basically say, go and recruit as many people as you can to use your product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That sort of approach that says, okay there are three types of people out there:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>one who are absolutely interested in your product or the project you are building [which]are ground zero sort of customers or people;</li>\r\n	<li>Then there are the first degree people who are sort of interested but they are not ready to commit, but they are sort of leaning forward to their future adopters; and,</li>\r\n	<li>the third one is people who are just not interested at all.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>So it would be far more efficient if you focused your resources on the &ldquo;ground zero&rdquo; and one after that, type of people. At Anahitapolis, if you realize even for the free account that we have, we actually have a form that people have to submit a 30-word short description of what they&rsquo;re trying to build using Anahita. And, we have people who write in very simple, they don&rsquo;t have to write anything elaborate, but they say I want to build a community for musicians or I want to try to build a community for students or project management and also we get all kinds of people who say oh I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m just hanging around, I like to see what&rsquo;s out there and those are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;the kind of people you want in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first several thousand people are very important in a community because you seed your community with people who are actually interested, genuinely interested in your product and they sort of define the future culture of your community</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the very first people, the &ldquo;ground zero&rdquo; people are people who actually pay and come in. That&rsquo;s a sign of commitment really, when someone is willing to give you money and after that people who usually join in for free and then later a lot of the paid members are coming out of those, so people who are not ready to commit right away, they can come in and just watch us and see how we use Anahita to run our daily operation. We never try to go out there and convince people. When people contact us, say tell me is Anahita better than the other product or you know how should I compare and I say I really don&rsquo;t know. You should go and try all of them, if you find what you like, great &ndash; if not, then come and use Anahita. Then you have every reason, because every person who joined they have their own unique list of reasons, you have to find yours.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not well received universally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think a lot of people in the business world may disagree with me, the concept of because they say no, get as many people as you can and bundle them with promotions and all kinds of promises, just get them in. The thing is &ndash; we are not doing an impulse sale. Every person that joins Anahitapolis&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; it&rsquo;s a commitment&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a relationship. We are with them in a journey for one year and to sort of build their technology and to help them, to teach them and they sort of become part of a tribe and a family. You can&rsquo;t do that with the impulse sort of base, search and sell marketing techniques. It&rsquo;s also far more resourceful that you focus on those who care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we have a very sort of appreciative community right now. Like every morning it&rsquo;s such a joy to interact with people and even when they sort of write things or just get a little irritated we can understand. Learning a new technology is very difficult. So that&rsquo;s only human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And how does your new pricing structure fit with this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well we had a premium plan for people who join in and they basically were given access to everything on Anahitapolis but then we realized some people needed private consulting. They either have projects they don&rsquo;t want to share the information publicly or semi-publicly on Anahitapolis or they really require face-to-face interaction for the problems we solve, they want to develop a strategy or they signed a non-disclosure with their client, so we sort of bundled some consulting hours with the basic premium rates and offered those as an option. So we have a gold plan that comes with 2 hours of sort of consulting with one of the core team members and also the other one has 12 hours and for consulting rates we calculated at a discounted rate which brings value for people because a lot of people who join Anahitapolis, they are building their next sort of business model on the web, or they are building a project that is very dear to them and they need advice, how to be resourceful or how to develop a strategy or they want us to review their code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So a lot of them end up spending way more. We had people from the first tribe or from the previous tribe, they spent up to 100 times more than the basic fee with us and that&rsquo;s how we funded the project in the last 2 years. I think that&rsquo;s very consistent with the results that your guests from Akeeba, and they mentioned that most of the donations or even fees are coming from people who are already paying customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{That show is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/trts6\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Freemium, or not to Freemium\">&ldquo;Freemium, or not to Freemium&rdquo; with David Deutsch and Nicholas Dionysopoulos</a>&nbsp;&mdash; scroll down near the bottom -Bob}</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh you liked that, that was fascinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That was very consistent with the same results that we had because we had a lot of people who sign up and then after awhile they get so excited and they want to commit more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t get angry because I sent an email saying &ldquo;what do you think about the new pricing structure?&rdquo;, and a word came out in his email that was interesting. He said &ldquo;coaching&rdquo;. And what you described to me didn&rsquo;t sound so much like consulting but like coaching which is so consistent with how you are on your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It is, because social networking software is not like a blog that you just install and it works or any other software, it requires community development, it requires user adoption, and also you have to be very resourceful because you have no idea &ndash; you cannot predict how your community is going to turn out or use your service or software. You have to start small and get people to use your service and gradually as you observe their behaviour you add more to your service and that way you make sure most of your resources are focused on things that are actually being used. And that is something that people need guidance with sometimes. So, yeah, so that really our new sort of premium plans came out of a pattern that we observed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like that technical discipline, the pattern and your business framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, that&rsquo;s a very Hackerpreneur thing I suppose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I like this idea that everybody&rsquo;s learning and that&rsquo;s why on my site I have Learning Centers &ndash; I don&rsquo;t call them forums anymore, because I just don&rsquo;t like the connotation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I think so too. Our vision is that on Anahitapolis someday we turn into an on-line learning management system for people to come and not only develop their development skills, they also develop their business development skills and community management skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a big ambition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh we&rsquo;re going for big ambitions. [laughter] it&rsquo;s all about world liberation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s funny how you look at Google and what Google does and what you should bring in to Anahita or not bring into Anahita, everybody&rsquo;s comparing on the Discussion Groups. But I think you&rsquo;re mostly going your own way, which is better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I think every project should focus on that. It&rsquo;s okay to get inspirations but you look at your own state of being, you look at your own community, you look at your own needs, and your own evolution path. They say that you were born an original, don&rsquo;t die a copy. I don&rsquo;t know who said that but it&rsquo;s a brilliant quote. We are destined to be on our own evolution path and go there and be very competitive rather than trying to be somebody else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Ash I want to thank you for your long explanations about code libraries and other technical stuff. It&rsquo;s very helpful. [laughter] I usually read that when I know I&rsquo;m going to read the Nooku Google Group and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m always thinking the two together and bothering you two about well Nooku&rsquo;s doing this , but that was a good one with the code library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s good, yeah glad to clarify that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s funny that people are talking about, &ldquo;no I don&rsquo;t want to do an app, I don&rsquo;t want to do a component, I want to do a library&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Actually it&rsquo;s interesting, a lot of people on Anahitatopolis right now are in a way that I actually had to put an example how to create libraries using basically like how we did it. So a lot of people are interested and I guess that&rsquo;s a good sign, people are really going for, you know, they are really thinking outside of the box, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;s going to be all these little frameworks coming out that will be released GPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;That is actually, like that would be something we look forward to, that people would actually build their own projects based on our Anahita. So it is also we want it to be used as a end user but at the same time it&rsquo;s a building block to build other projects, and that&rsquo;s what we are going for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the framework aspect of Anahita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I had a question which I didn&rsquo;t put on my notes, you have an app called pages &ndash; right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;re also considering a blog app? What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;The name. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a pattern &ndash; it&rsquo;s the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;At the beginning actually it is, we started pages because we needed to post documentations and discussion boards are not the best place to post tutorials or documentation. So it came out of a need and we started very simple, it&rsquo;s basically you sort of put a list of pages within every profile and there are commentable and you keep revisions, and people can colloborate on editing the content. So a blog follows a chronological sort of process, like today&rsquo;s post, today&rsquo;s news is old news tomorrow. So there is that real time aspect into it. All of them are media content when you go to the media notes, when you go to the heart of the system, but how you use them sort of defines what they are. Pages are more timeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell you, it&rsquo;s one thing to read the discussions on your site but it&rsquo;s another thing to be able to talk to you about them, so I really appreciate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, you&rsquo;re welcome and yeah, the difference between pages and blogs sometimes I wonder &ldquo;are they the same?&rdquo; Because I was thinking about blogs, for example, that let&rsquo;s say I create a blog and if I allow people to also post blogs in a group and isn&rsquo;t that the same as discussion board and topics?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You had this whole thing with forums awhile ago. The same kind of thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, well forums, that&rsquo;s true. I think the concept of forums is that people want to sort of attach a traditional discussion board or forum to Anahita and use it, which is fine, it&rsquo;s just not something we want to do. We think social apps you get instance of social apps running reading profile, that&rsquo;s how things are done in a social network. A global discussion board is something a lot of people did in the past decades and they can continue to do so but that&rsquo;s just not the direction we are going. So first there was a lot of discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it&rsquo;s the same kind of you know it&rsquo;s not as static with a social network, but a blog is more static and that&rsquo;s why you have the Pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;They&rsquo;re right now very generic but they will be different. The active use of them, the context of them are different and over time the content created for them will also be different. So, yes, very similar. You think pages in the blogs are similar that you need pages and discussion board and photos they are all similar. But over time their use becomes different and that actually separates the context of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the context and user experience because apps are just different ways of interacting with nodes, graphs and stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;We actually called the apps a playground, that&rsquo;s actually one of, we sort of were looking for a metaphor for the apps, they are like a playground of how things interact with each other. So depending on the playground people interact or nodes interact a little differently and in a blog little things make a difference that makes it a blog app. But we just have to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I mean I would build a blog as more of an expression tool that I write something today and tomorrow it&rsquo;s old news and I tag them as I go so it&rsquo;s more fluid versus when I am creating pages or documentation, it&rsquo;s timeless. The same document can be useful next year and I organize them in categories ahead of time and I actually build a sort of on-line book or booklets or instruction manual. So all of them are content but the context is different and at the heart of the system those are all media nodes. Like when you go to the very atomic level at Anahita everything is built out of nodes, graphs and stories, like the same reusable elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Which the next time you&rsquo;re on, that&rsquo;s what I want to get in to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s something I saw on the database that just had me scratching my head. I thought I&rsquo;d leave that for next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Which is a good segue because we&rsquo;re out of time. I like to keep it around 25 minutes. My unscientific optimal length. That was a very fast hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It was yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It was fun. The podcasts with you are always fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob (closing):</strong>&nbsp;Thank you very much.

This is part one of our two part discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website is Anahitapolis.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcripts of this podcast are graciously sponsored by Anahita&trade;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;On&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2010/tbbs9\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Anahita Social Engine with Rastin Mehr and Ash Sanieyan\">April 22, 2010 I had the pleasure of introducing Rastin and Ash and Anahita</a>. On June 17th last year we ended the season with a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2010/tienda-nooku-fw-anahita-face-my-round-table\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tienda, Nooku FW, Anahita Face my Round Table\">blow-out show&nbsp;</a>with over 10 people on my podcast including Ash and Rastin. It&rsquo;s good to get caught up with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great to be here Bob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Same here Bob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I noticed that at the recent Joomla and Beyond conference attendees were into ice cream and beer, but you&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2011/09/the-lovely-folks-who-supply-our-caffeine/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Lovely Folks who supply our caffeine\">blog about coffee</a>. Is the coffee really that good in Vancouver?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;We love coffee. [laughter] We actually, well, where I live on the 6th floor on top of a coffee shop is a very beautiful spot in Yaletown in Vancouver, so and that&rsquo;s basically the place that I spend a lot of time working, instead of going to our office. We only go to our office for meetings but coding and all of that I would rather be surrounded by strangers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You find that motivating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I guess it&rsquo;s a social place, you know you have the cafe and you have the sun and we had a bit of sun this summer in Vancouver, so that&rsquo;s good. And you meet new people and yeah, I guess I find it very&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, Rastin&rsquo;s very coffee shop oriented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;and I love coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I change between coffee, libraries, home, different places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;We actually have a coffee group on Anahitapolis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh really, I missed that. I&rsquo;ll have to search for that because I missed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh we do have a beer and drinks as groups do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, we have one for food and drinks and one for coffee because we figure those are the things that bring people together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Or divide people. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So for those who aren&rsquo;t sure what is Anahita?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Anahita is a social networking engine. You can think of it as a sort of web-based operating system for building any kind of businesses that you want to build, or projects that have a social networking context into them. So you install the social engine as your framework and platform and you can build social apps using Anahita framework and you can host them on the Anahita platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and that platform is a free download.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It is free as free beer or free coffee. So you can basically just go to our site and download a free coffee of &ndash; a free copy &ndash; [laughter] and you can just download a free copy for yourself. If you want apps you can sign up as a premier member but core framework and platform is free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and the core framework is written with Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, we use Nooku Framework as well as Anahita comes with its own framework, so the Anahita apps are actually developed using Anahita Framework. Ash is the framework architect, so he can tell you all about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, basically we use different parts of Nooku, yes, we are using those and at the same time we have to develop a lot of tools and API&rsquo;s and classes ourselves which, over time, we recognized the patterns and we put those as a framework. So a lot of our apps basically using those as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;We sort of have a little sort of motto about Anahita being RAD, SaaSy, and Social because she is now a rapid application development framework, great for developing software asa service; and, social in the sense that it is specialized for developing social applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I thought that it&rsquo;s written in Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; border: 1px solid rgb(108, 182, 86); padding: 5px;\">\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I mean you have to really look &ndash; Nooku Framework is not a box that you can look into it. It&rsquo;s a collection of classes and architecture and philosophies. If you want to build one application you completely use one framework, every aspect of it, if you want to extend to building a platform and other bigger system, well you use parts of the things that you really need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a lot of other projects that we build on Ruby on Rails, the stepping stone was Ruby on Rails, but as the project goes on they build their own libraries and their patterns and over time the Rails, for example, was only used as part of it as ingredients, one of the ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, same as Nooku Framework lots of patterns, lots of object classes we use on Nooku Framework. But, as in development for the past two years, we have developed a lot of Pattern Designs and we sort of had to use across different apps so we sort of have to put those in, and encapsulate them as Anahita Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is focused on building social apps. So I don&rsquo;t think you can really say, you know, Nooku Framework is applied to treat it as one box that everything has to be built on it, it is more like a box of ingredients that you can pick a different aspect of it and extend it to meet our own needs.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I think we&rsquo;re going to come back to that. You have, you&rsquo;re working on Anahita 1.7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s actually 1.6, the next release, and then 1.7. 1.6 is very likely to be a transition release, so it&rsquo;s going to be an Embryo Release which we&rsquo;re going to install it for Anahitapolis and use it ourselves. And then from that point we start building the features that we are expecting to have for 1.7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.7 will be the first release that people can sort of operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s great going blank on the air &ndash; right? [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I thought you were taking notes or&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m thinking &ndash; I had the impression 1.6 was almost, it was just a stepping stone on the way to your 1.7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well let me, a lot of things we&rsquo;ve done for 1.5 we didn&rsquo;t, we sort of had to make a lot of guesses about how users, about how people use the system. So we sort of had to bring of a lot of different areas and the 1.6 we sort of had to direct parts of the {indecipherable} after seeing what people have been doing with Anahita for the past year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, part of Anahita is completely rewritten, for example the domain library is one of our basically&hellip; our libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; border: 1px solid rgb(108, 182, 86); padding: 5px;\">\r\n<p>At the time that we started 1.5 we were so young and experimenting, so we had to put something together to make it work and we had the idea we had the philosophy we didn&rsquo;t have enough experience. In 1.6 that library has been completely rewritten, there is a lot of great things, a lot more than before and performance wise it has been tuned. Also a lot of our apps are also shrinking. A lot of patterns we use in our apps are even going back to the framework, meaning that our apps are also more shrinking.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;In terms of size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;In terms of size, not functionality. More functionality but a lot less code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Actually, on that point it was shocking for me to look at your apps under the components folder, because they were so sparse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, wait until the next one &ndash; you&rsquo;re probably going to see only a fraction of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, we are already rewriting the apps for 1.6 and they are literally sort of cut down to half &ndash; the size of the code. And we basically, whatever we learned the past six months we will be putting that into practice and improving the design. And one reason we are doing it in two stages is that features &ndash; when we build features we like to build it live.&nbsp;<strong>As we add the features on Anahitapolis and observe how people use them and we improve it on a daily basis</strong>. So all the new features that we&rsquo;re going to have in 1.7 that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is partly because social networking is not a well defined context. It&rsquo;s not like you build an on-line invoicing system, or an on-line project management system, or like a CMS. Those are pretty much well defined what you&rsquo;re building. Social networking is still a lot of experiments are happening, a lot of, you can build social networking in so many different ways.&nbsp;<strong>The only way for us to get the features right is to basically introduce them in small bits to people and observe how they use it and improve them and that&rsquo;s how a lot of our sort of features over the design concepts came out.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;And still we&rsquo;re improving on a lot of things that we thought we knew, we realized that might not necessarily work and a lot of it can be guessed that you know, we sort of had the intuition or actually becoming more real. So {decipherable}&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So, when I&rsquo;m on your site I should push things more. [laughter] I just go into the Discussions and that&rsquo;s it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;d like to repeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well when I&rsquo;m on Anahitapolis I should do more things because I just go to the Discussion Groups. I don&rsquo;t post any To-Do&rsquo;s or anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh okay. We do most of that work right now. I don&rsquo;t think followers of groups can post To-Do&rsquo;s. You can do it on your own personal profile but we are using our own tools. We use the tools that we build ourselves to basically operate Anahitapolis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, Anahitapolis is basically the City of Anahita &ndash; it&rsquo;s the place that we build Anahita software and also distribute it and provide support, for those people who don&rsquo;t know. And we basically use our own groups and discussions and photos and to do task manager and all of that to manage our projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I wanted you to explain what a Hackenpreneur is (scroll down at<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2011/06/busting-5-myths-about-the-anahita/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bustin 5 Myths About Anahita\">http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2011/06/busting-5-myths-about-the-anahita/</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh a hackerpreneur. A hackerpreneur is a &ldquo;Hacker + Entrepreneur&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; in a sense that Paul Graham defined, who is a computer science venture capitalist, and someone that I really admire. A hacker is someone who is a very good technologist and can come up with unique solutions to product technology problems.&nbsp;<strong>And Hackerpreneurs are basically hackers and technologists who have a business sense and these people are a very deadly species.</strong>&nbsp;[laughter] Because yes, they are very intimidating when an MBA or a business person encounters a Hackerpreneur they get really intimidated because it&rsquo;s a lot easier for a hacker to learn business than for a business person to become a hacker. And a lot of sort of great hackers in history are people who started, you know all about the Apple Computers and FaceBook and Oracle and Google and all the founders, if you look into by definition they were Hackerpreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And you wrote a blog post about this saying that Hackerpreneurs are best suited to using Anahita. Did I understand that right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well out of all the people applying [to join an Anahita Tribe] they were the easiest because when you join in and Anahita is really a tool box, it&rsquo;s not a point and click kind of technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; border: 1px solid rgb(108, 182, 86); padding: 5px;\">\r\n<p>These are people who build their own businesses by putting together the building blocks, so they have knowledge of technology and business, and they are the ones who feel most comfortable, and they get most excited when they see something like Anahita, because they sort of have knowledge both in the business area and technology and programming.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m finding that&rsquo;s a general view with open source software, that people who will get into the code even if they don&rsquo;t have a computer science degree, but they&rsquo;ll get in the code, seem best suited for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you don&rsquo;t have to have a computer science degree to become a hacker. You need to have the passion and spend a lot of time programming and read a lot and learn a lot.&nbsp;<strong>It&rsquo;s sort of a passion that you sort of nurture</strong>. After a while hackers learn to treat business problems just like software problems. It&rsquo;s basically a function that builds an algorithm that you put in $100 you get $300 out and you build a business model. They are very comfortable to break any kind of rules that is traditionally practiced in the business world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s very important because the rules are being changed all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s true, they change so many things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s all about the efficiency. See, when you are a Hackerpreneur if something is not efficient the system is broken so you just fix it by coming up with a new algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;They look at the business as a system, that&rsquo;s true. Like historically we changed so many things. Like in the business world everything is secretive and in this side they share everything. In the business world they came up with patents and copyrights, here they came up with GPL and Creative Commons, and they developed completely different business models and out of that. So yeah, Hackerpreneurs do things differently and that&rsquo;s the hacker part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve pushed things, and I was all through the development of Anahita when you started with Joomla and then you went with Nooku and all of that and then when I installed Anahita I made sure that was a separate site because I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure if it was Joomla or not so I kept it separate and it&rsquo;s been very good, it&rsquo;s been keeping my mind agile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been watching you sort of building your site and I admire a lot of the experiments you&rsquo;ve done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t pay him to say that &ndash; honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;We get such a kick, both Ash and I to see people how they can use Anahita in different contexts, and push the limits&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s because I busted out of the Shiraz template.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip;actually, me and Rastin often have arguments about this because sometimes people might do the things that we didn&rsquo;t necessarily anticipate it and we sort of want to correct them but I say no, let&rsquo;s let them experiment, that&rsquo;s the whole idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;No, no, no, no, no. You&rsquo;re calling your software &ldquo;embryo releases&rdquo; and &ldquo;birth releases&rdquo; and when your children grow up they become things you either don&rsquo;t want them to be or have no idea they would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly &ndash; let them grow. But we are here for the support regardless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;When your software becomes a teenager, you&rsquo;ll start aging. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Hopefully not. I mean the whole idea of calling &ldquo;embryos&rdquo; and &ldquo;birth&rdquo; is&nbsp;<strong>building an eco system of ever-growing new organisms</strong>. That&rsquo;s part of the change that is happening in open source software I think is because software is becoming more and more like living organisms. They are constantly changing and evolving and that&rsquo;s how software should be and you can see the whole model released early and often and more projects are now going towards that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Actually I know you guys are innovative&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;&hellip; and there&rsquo;s a discussion about how to update the template because it&rsquo;s like the intersection of you know what you&rsquo;re given versus you&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;well you have customization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not saying this was usual and someone said well you know you should put in your own CSS and put that into the array that Gantry, whatever, so I&rsquo;m thinking that doesn&rsquo;t do it and I&rsquo;m thinking if there&rsquo;s anybody who&rsquo;s going to do something to experiment it would be you. So I&rsquo;m thinking to myself what we could do because you might actually give it a go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well we are looking at how people experience difficulties and/or find innovative ways and we sort of incorporate that. Eventually I can see Anahita having its own template framework because CMS and social networks are very different. CMS, I mean look at Joomla for example, for 6 years that it has been around the structure of the html and user interface hasn&rsquo;t changed much, it&rsquo;s pretty much the same. So, you have all the time in the world to sit and bundle it with all kinds of fancy graphics and look and feel and come up with really elaborate designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A social network is constantly changing. I mean if you are on Facebook or Twitter, maybe not as much Twitter, but Facebook or Google+ you can see the user interfaces are constantly changing and in order to be able to keep up with that fast paced evolution you gotta keep the user interfaces very light and so that&rsquo;s why we always tell people that especially when you start early keep the branding very minimal and focus on the user experience aspects of branding rather than the look and feel and colour because in this game you&rsquo;ve got to be able to keep up with the changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Of course that&rsquo;s what everybody focuses on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. But regarding the template in general the problem with that, that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve been talking about a lot, me and Rastin and incidentally we talked about it yesterday and the day before and yes, in the beginning we sort of had told people well you know separate the template, put your own template but people don&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s not really a good solution for people. So, in terms of update it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re going to incorporate something that helps people migrate their templates also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It is an ongoing issue and something we sort of are aware of and it&rsquo;s for the first time we are building software that the user interface is constantly changing and we have to sort of develop ways to help people sort of keep up. That&rsquo;s just one of the new things you have to deal with when you&rsquo;re building social networking technologies. Another challenge that we have that when you&rsquo;re building a technology like this we still use existing tools and there is a lot of CMS tools used to build Anahita and they are not the best tools but we just don&rsquo;t have any other option at this moment. So a lot of the shortcomings that are coming in is because we try to sort of shoehorn CMS tools into a social networking concept and as we move forward and we write and develop social networking specific templates or user interface or libraries and these issues are going to be improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re going to have Anahita 1.7 on the new Nooku Server Alpha3 &ndash; right? Is that the intention?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;We are going to use Nooku Server instead of Joomla as the platform. Right now is {undecipherable}. So as soon as Nooku Server is ready and we are ready, we&rsquo;re going to start merging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Because there&rsquo;s a few things there that you could use to help you with these shortcomings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Um, yes because Nooku Framework is geared to be a less of a CMS and more of a generic platform, so it&rsquo;s a better option; and, that is why we sort of decided to move away from Joomla because Joomla, unfortunately or fortunately, I mean it&rsquo;s for their audience, they are so much becoming a CMS. Maybe that&rsquo;s what the audience wants, but for Anahita we needed a generic web platform &ndash; something that comes with basically basic extension management and user management, menu management and also more flexibility to customize, write and overwrite. Joomla is very focused on menu management and all the stuff URLs are created based on how menus are organized and it&rsquo;s not really application friendly environment. And we are still dealing with some difficulties running an application within Joomla. So Nooku Server gives us a lot more flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and with that we&rsquo;re at the end of Part 1 if you could believe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, that went really fast. That was fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob (closing):</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Anahita Framework is available as a Free Open Source Software. Go to Anahitapolis.com, click &ldquo;Download&rdquo; on the main menu, and the first item is Anahita, so click that and you&rsquo;ll be look at the right side of the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rastin, Ash, thank you for taking time to join me today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And thank you for sponsoring this show&rsquo;s transcripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(43, 79, 3, 'Tbbs39', '<p>Welcome to episode 39 of The Bob Bloom Show. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, October 06th, 2011.&nbsp; Provincial election day for my fellow Ontarians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I talk to&nbsp; you about why I came home to Joomla ecommerce in general, and to Tienda in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really, isn&rsquo;t it more interesting to talk about the technology, and not so much the journey?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well,&nbsp; apparently not, because people are undertaking a similar journey. At the&nbsp;last Joomla! Users Group Toronto meet-up, this topic was raised.&nbsp; The LinkedIn &ldquo;Ecommerce and Online Marketing Experts&rdquo; group has a topic &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Which-is-best-Open-Source-73825.S.73472562?qid=ddb6e3fa-ffa0-45d6-9664-aa22ecfb4305&amp;trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Which is the best Open Source eCommerce platform in terms of features, flexibility and scalability? \">Which is the best Open Source eCommerce platform in terms of features, flexibility and scalability?</a>&ldquo;. The second comment sums it up very nicely:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no silver bullet though, obviously, each platform has its own set of pros &amp; cons.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no silver bullet. The first thing you have to know is yourself. What&rsquo;s your plan? Then find the solution that best matches your plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My own point of view is not to run ecomm sites for myself, but, rather, to specialize in ecomm technology as a consultant, for clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started out with Joomla ecommerce, with Virtuemart, in 2006. Earlier this year, I looked at what else was out there. Other Joomla carts.&nbsp; Drupal, WordPress, and independent PHP carts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, the lure of greener pastures was strong. But the pastures are not greener. Each cart has its own pros and cons, and many times it seemed that I would be substituting one set of problems with another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See, I knew where I was coming from: Joomla, Virtuemart, Tienda. Joomla extensions, Joomla templates. And I have a vision of where the future of Joomla ecommerce is going too &mdash; yes I do! Listen to my podcast&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/tbbs21\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Emergence of Nooku Framework Based Joomla eCommerce\">Emergence of Nooku Framework Based Joomla eCommerce</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I travelled distant lands, only to appreciate where I came from even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The free independent open source PHP carts are similarly organized to Joomla and the Joomla cart projects. Each of these independent carts has their own community, their own core software, their own way of releasing their software, their own cottage industry of add-ons and consultants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some carts had kick-ass feature sets. For features that were lacking, for customizations, it was the same type of chase as for Joomla. Ultimately, what difference does it make that I have to chase different things down for different carts? I still have to spend the same time. No cart offers the &ldquo;ultimate portfolio&rdquo; of features that would save me from spending time chasing down add-ons, or poring over the code to find out how to do the customizations myself.&nbsp; By the time I learn the ins-and-outs of a particular cart, the players, the outstanding third-party devs,&nbsp; I could be advancing Joomla ecommerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I selected fifteen independent PHP carts to look at. Plus Drupal &amp; WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomato Cart made quite an impression, but it is way too nascent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Media site is WordPress, and in specific scenarios WordPress with the ecommerce plugin work out well. But beyond these specific scenarios, I&rsquo;m not so convinced. Drupal was an adventure, having looked at it for my Media site and for ecommerce, but personally it is not my cup of tea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are really blessed to have these three outstanding&nbsp; free open source projects in our midst: Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal. They are outstanding. But, I also use Anahita for my Discussion site, and Anahita is outstanding too. Things are changing and Anahita is pointing the way. And, of course, there&rsquo;s the Nooku Server, which is nearing Alpha 4 and is outstanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since no single cart fit all scenarios, I should&nbsp; specialize in a portfolio of carts. Match the cart that best fit my clients&rsquo; business plans, and then install/manage those sites. I already have my Joomla-Virtuemart specialty. Add Tienda to that. I have years working with WordPress and actually have a site using an early version of the WP-ecommerce plugin. Then add Prestashop, Magento, and OpenCart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s be realistic here: to what extent can I specialize in six individual carts. Am I really a Solutions Provider, or am I specializing in a technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I the guy who attracts clients, matches &lsquo;em up with the cart they need, and then sub-contracts the roll-up-the-sleeves work to others? Is my business really acquiring clients, owning the cash inflow of that client, and then parcelling out the technical work at a cost below my billings, and pocketing the difference? If so, I better remake myself into a marketing machine and acquire clients! I can flat-out tell you that this is not where my talents, passion, and inclinations are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I the guy who maintains a portfolio of clients, does the roll-up-the-sleeves work myself, and manages my clients&rsquo; sites throughout their website life-cycles? If so, my clients are end-users, not other consultants. So, I better have a way of acquiring clients, and familiarizing myself enough with these various carts. However, with many clients using many carts, there&rsquo;s only so much under-the-hood work I will be able to accomplish. There&rsquo;s no doubt I&rsquo;ll need to outsource custom work, and that poses risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I own my client and their revenue. So, I don&rsquo;t want programmers who make themselves indispensible. A wide-awake client will discern who is doing the &ldquo;real&rdquo; work, and then dump me for the programmer to spare themselves the mark-up. Another risk: to depend on a small group of individuals so much that a programmer going on holiday or off-line can put my billings in jeopardy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important build a multi-tiered portfolio of sites &amp; clients. So, then, my business would really be to acquire and maintain a multi-tiered portfolio of sites &amp; clients; and, to maintain a portfolio of at least somewhat fungible sub-contractors. Which puts me pretty well in the first category I rejected: that of &ldquo;the guy who attracts clients, matches &lsquo;em up with the cart they need, and then sub-contracts the roll-up-the-sleeves work to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, I&rsquo;m the rare breed: the specialist. The guy who knows the technology. The guy other consultants and end-users seek out to &ldquo;do things&rdquo; with the software.&nbsp; This is what I&rsquo;m well suited for. So, forget about knowing a bunch of carts well, but not deeply, I have to select the single cart to specialize in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, naturally, the answer is the one with the biggest market share, and then carve out a niche for myself. Problem: today&rsquo;s hot cart has its day in the sun, and then the new kid on the block with the shinier toy comes out, and poof goes my speciality. So, I have to &ldquo;roll over&rdquo; my&nbsp; specialty every so often, flitting from hot cart to hot cart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would it not be the smart play to specialize in a cart that has both market share and staying power? And for that, there is one single cart bar none: Magento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before I get into Magento, let me continue about the independent PHP carts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve had peanut butter cups? The combination of peanut butter &amp; chocolate together is pretty good. Just ask my children. But independent PHP carts? It&rsquo;s like getting the peanut butter but not the chocolate. A cart without the CMS really stinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Menus, modules, articles. I just take it for granted, because I am steeped in Joomla &amp; WordPress. Oh boy, most of the independent PHP carts, forget about it. It didn&rsquo;t take long before I was researching Joomla integration for each cart. And, it was very interesting to see in the forums that others were doing the same thing. I would actually give up sexy cart features if I could get the mundane Joomla menu &amp; module &amp; templating functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want a blog or a forum to go with your cart, you have to install Joomla or WordPress or something too. If your Joomla forum needs login to comment, then now you have separate logins for Joomla &amp; for your cart. My client is going request single sign-on, of course, and such integration is not trivial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My clients need both chocolate and peanut butter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reseller program is an important thing. I specialize in the technology, I suport my clients for that technolgoy. But who supports me? Where do I go for training? Where do I go for help when I have a problem? Look, a strong community is important. But, who is supposed to help me when the chips are down. Community forums with unanswered threads, email listings prefaced with &ldquo;no support provided&rdquo;, and a hodge-podge of third party devs &amp; consultants doing their own thing does not cut it when my client is all over me and my billing is imperiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reseller program is a formal thing. A consultant pays the technology company a fee. In return, the consultant gets access to the technology to resell to clients, along with support and training. Sometimes, training is mandatory &ndash; after successful completion the consultant can add the technology&rsquo;s logo to their materials indicating to the buying public a minimum standard of proficiency with that technology. Also, it is understood that the technology company has given their seal of approval to the reseller which boosts confidence among the buying public, who may know the technology but not the reseller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s only one reseller program (did I miss any): Magento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, why did I forsake Magento? Mabye I could carve a niche building Magento add-ons on top of being a reseller. Magento has market share, and reseller programs &mdash; there&rsquo;s room for me. And, eBay bought out Magento lock, stock and barrel, and is forging ahead with XCommerce, which sure looks interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magento is not a silver bullet; and, it is getting crowded. Now that it&rsquo;s a corporate behemoth, maybe I should check out the other behemoths and upstarts too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that I want to be part of a corporate behemoth. That entails certain benefits and risks. And Magento being subsumed into a huge public company, I think, augments Joomla ecommerce, not hurts it. Why? Because Joomla ecommerce has an important place in the ecommerce pantheon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those that want to bootstrap their own ecommerce sites, Joomla offers tremendous power, lots of freedom of choice, ease of entry of price and technology, and a bullish future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla is hotbed of technology. Joomla ecommerce is at an inflection point of advancement. Virtuemart 2 is on the verge of being released, Tienda is racing to version 1.0, Anahita is just sitting there waiting to be integrated with ecommerce, Nooku Framework &amp; Server are maturing, the hot Joomla development activity now is the platform and we will see a very interesting upcoming Joomla Long Term Release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now is the time to come home to Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda is a full featured Joomla cart extension that has been out for nearly two years. There is a unified vision of what the code is supposed to look like, which is quite an achievement. The code is Joomla MVC. Tienda is designed from the ground up to be customized and extended without touching the core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda is a professionally managed project. It&rsquo;s groundbreaking Redmine Projects site is actively maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a commercial outfit behind Tienda that offers paid support, which means that there is access to the team for support. There is a &ldquo;partner program&rdquo;, which is not designed as a reseller program per se, but it is on the right track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had fun digging into Tienda&rsquo;s code, and doing my Tienda Distro &amp; components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob (closing):</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having traversed the PHP ecommerce world, I&rsquo;ve come home to Joomla ecommerce, and to Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla ecommerce occupies a sweet position in the ecommerce pantheon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(44, 80, 3, 'Tbbs40', '<p>Welcome to The Bob Bloom Show. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, November 17th, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I expected to do bi-weekly podcasts this fall, but with my Club Commerce concluding a proof-of-concept phase, and with the start of its Membership Drive, my podcast schedule has not settled down. It will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started podcasting on February 18, 2010. This is my 40th podcast of my &ldquo;Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. In total I&rsquo;ve produced 64 podcasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 40 Bob Bloom Shows, a quarter of them mention the Nooku Framework. Many shows are devoted to it, with interviews of Nooku Framework developers. Many shows manage to weave the Nooku Framework into the conversation. &ldquo;Nooku&rdquo; is in the title of many shows. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; Nooku Framework promotion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So explaining to you why I find it un-usable is not fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s podcast is inspired by two things: by Nicholas Dionysolpoulos&rsquo; laid-back, easy going blog post, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.dionysopoulos.me/why-i-m-not-using-the-nooku-framework-any-more.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Why I\'m not using the Nooku Framework any more\">Why I&rsquo;m not using the Nooku Framework any more</a>&ldquo;; and, more so, by my own recent experience with the Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp; (November 17, 2011): Nicholas took down his article. I looked at the cache, which out of respect to Nicholas I will not link, and read the comments on this cached page. You commenters should re-post your comments in your blogs.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE (August&nbsp;31, 2015 -- yes, almost four years later!): Nicholas&#39; article is back up, so I am linking to it.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE (August 31, 2015): This article is kick-ass&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://ninjaforge.com/blog/324-so-wtf-happened-around-here\" target=\"_blank\">http://ninjaforge.com/blog/324-so-wtf-happened-around-here​</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first time, I recorded a podcast with Nicholas that I had to&nbsp; delete. Unheard of! Would I refuse to publish a podcast with David Deutsch, Rastin Mehr, or anyone else? No.&nbsp; But this time it&rsquo;s different. As I told Nicholas, I want people to understand that my decision to back away from the Nooku Framework is mine alone. Nicholas is very gracious in letting me hit that delete button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I told Nicholas that I disagreed with the Ad Hominen of his blog post. In general, I am not a fan of this approach anyways. In this case, I think it diminished very powerful technical points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My podcasts are synonymous with the Nooku Framework, and I have to explain myself. For all my excitement about the Nooku Framework, my actual experience with it leads me to drop it. This decision is recent, and only by coincidence did it occur at the same time Nicholas was tweeting in real-time about his experience with Akeeba Subscriptions &amp; the Nooku Framework. So, it&rsquo;s not a matter of &ldquo;siding with Nicholas&rdquo; against anyone or anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y&rsquo;know, I feel compelled to enumerate my Nooku Framework bona fides. To confirm my credentials, to assure that I will be perceived properly. Forget about it. I&rsquo;m not apologizing for my direct experience with the Nooku Framework that resulted in my decision to drop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t apologize for deciding to use WordPress instead of Joomla for my Media site. When I set up my Media site, WordPress was the better platform for what I wanted to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, many versions are used to build Joomla extensions, but only one version is installable on a Joomla site. For me, this renders the Nooku Framework unusable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Club Commerce is a new limited membership Club for Tienda users. I maintain a Tienda Distro (not a fork!); and, a &ldquo;Distro Control Centre&rdquo; component, a separate custom component that is used in conjunction with my Club&rsquo;s Distro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My plan is to use the Nooku Framework as much as possible. Why? To use less code and speed up turnaround.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, finally, I wrote version 1.0 of my Control Centre component using the Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I have a problem. What version of the Nooku Framework do I use? Originally, I thought I should use whatever version Ninjaboard is using, since Ninjaboard is such a well known NFW based Joomla extension. As of two weeks ago when I last checked, the latest Ninjaboard&nbsp; release is version 1.55 Stable revision 2352, which uses Nooku version 0.7.0 Alpha 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then along came Nicholas&rsquo; Akeeba Subscriptions, with Tienda integration. Akeeba Subs uses a newer version of the NFW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is not that these Joomla extensions use different versions of the NFW. The problem is that one, and only one, version of the NFW can exist on a Joomla site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NFW versions are so different that a Joomla extension written with one version will not work with another version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, installing Ninjaboard means you cannot install Akeeba Subscriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the NFW for my Control Centre component means choosing, on behalf of my Club Members, whether they can use Ninjaboard or Akeeba Subs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of my Club is to deliver maximum Tienda technology to my Members. Choosing between one or other extension is antithetical to my Club&rsquo;s purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I cannot use the NFW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Akeeba Subs 2.0 does not use the NFW. But that does not get me off the hook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My using the NFW opens up the possibility that other NFW extensions, present and future, will not be installable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the exact same NFW version as Ninjaboard is not foolproof either. I need advanced notice from the Ninjaboard team of their switching to another NFW version. Even that is not enough, because Ninjaboard has a terrific updater within its administration. This updater upgrades the NFW as well as Ninjaboard. Even if I syncronize NFW versions with Ninjaboard, I then have to syncronize NFW updates on individual sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a general problem.&nbsp; When one extension upgrades to a newer NFW version and other extensions do not so upgrade, then this version problem rears its head again. NFW and extension upgrades have to happen in concert on individual websites, lest multiple NFW based Joomla extensions require multiple NFW versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that NFW upgrades should be managed in a separate Administrator component, and not within an individual NFW based Joomla extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also think that this version issue is more a practical matter and less of a hard technical issue.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing within NFW that is causing this problem. It comes down to the constraint that only one NFW version can exist in a Joomla site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicholas was way ahead of me about the version problem. His documentation and his download page were very clear that Ninjaboard and Akeeba Subs cannot co-exist. He was on the front-line of this problem. Obviously, there are a lot of Ninjaboard installations out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My interest is heighten because I am tying Tienda to the NFW through my independent components. If you need my Tax component for your Tienda site, and my components require the NFW, then to run Tienda, you need whatever version of the NFW that my components use. So, if you planned on using Ninjaboard for pre-sales questions, forget it. You have to choose between Tienda and Ninjaboard &mdash; not just between Ninjaboard and Akeeba Subs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Tax component is tiny rowboat compared to the size of S.S. Ninjaboard. But size does not matter here. My component is a critical piece of the Tienda site, and is here to stay. If other NFW based Joomla extensions do not work with my NFW version, they can&rsquo;t be used. It&rsquo;s as if Tienda shipped with the NFW, and I use the same version of NFW as Tienda at all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, this version problem is so dire that I have to hold my use of the NFW in abeyance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem of updating NFW based extensions has not even entered the picture for me. Although I think at some point it would be an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason I want to use the NFW is to code less, save time, and speed up turnaround. There&rsquo;s a definite upfront benefit. However, updates will be needed due to changes in the NFW, even when there may be no feature changes to code. So, there are &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; costs. I may have 50 little utility style NFW based components. So even a nominal 15 minutes per component to do downstream changes translates into 12 hours of solid work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The version problem is so dire that &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; updates do not matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Nooku Framework is in beta development, I&rsquo;ll&nbsp; see where it&rsquo;s at with these issues. In the meantime, it is not ready for my Joomla development work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

Today is Thursday, December 01st, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Yes, Virginia, Tienda is Ready!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At every single Toronto Joomla User Group meet-up &mdash; and I go to most of &lsquo;em! &mdash; I am told that Tienda is not ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, if you last downloaded Tienda six months ago, download it again. It&rsquo;s coming along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda is the real deal. Do you realize that it&rsquo;s been out for almost two years? It&rsquo;s gone through a ton of bug fixes from real-world usage. Some from me! Development is very active. Very active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are enough features in Tienda to rival Virtuemart. Meaning, there is enough raw power in Tienda to justify you kicking its tires. It is free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what I love about Tienda&rsquo;s code? There&rsquo;s a vision being expressed. This vision is Joomla MVC. This vision is that others can add on to Tienda without touching Tienda&rsquo;s source code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just read someone complain in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/e-commerce/shopping-cart/11340#rev-105247\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/e-commerce/shopping-cart/11340#rev-105247\">JED about Tienda&rsquo;s lack of form styling</a>. Well, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;V&rdquo; in MVC. Views. And Tienda expects you to customize the Views. Their focus is on the &ldquo;M&rdquo; and the &ldquo;C&rdquo;. Models. Controllers. Our job as consultants and users is to prettify and customize the Views. Even at that, the Views are not an afterthought. You need to understand Template Overrides to get the most out of Tienda. It is no surprise that I&rsquo;ve already included Template Overrides in my Club Commerce&rsquo;s Tienda Distro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda&rsquo;s code looks for plugins every-which-way, so that it is customizable without disturbing the source code. Third party developers take note! Do you have a Virtuemart add-on? Well, convert it to Tienda! Your add-on is MVC, right? So, it should be relatively easy to port it to Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a chicken-and-egg thing. I sense that third party developers want to see Tienda hit a critical mass before making the investment into creating &amp; maintaining third party extensions for it. People see that Tienda&rsquo;s add-on industry is still nascent, so they shy away from Tienda. The logic being that &ldquo;Tienda is not ready because it lacks third party add-ons&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrong!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda is ready! Third party developers: port your add-ons! The market is there, waiting for you. Email me your URLs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: Tienda is ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tweet Sweet Even in Heat</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Boom Boom Boom clip]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love that talk, when you talk like that, you knocks me out, right off my feet, hoo hoo hoo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oooh yeah, talk technical to me.

Why so surprised?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nooku Framework is still in &ldquo;alpha&rdquo;, so of course I&rsquo;m keeping my eye out how NFW progresses. I&rsquo;m sure that late &ldquo;beta&rdquo; and final &ldquo;stable&rdquo; versions will fine. Yes, I still read the daily Google Group&rsquo;s digests. Yes, I still read all the articles that come out. Yes, NFW is still a topic in my podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, there is something else. Remember that I use the Nooku Framework for real, every single day!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Club Commerce Discussion site is the Anahita distro. I use the Anahita Social Engine! Anahita uses the Nooku Framework. My site is live, baby. Been live for, what, five months now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love what Rastin and Ash are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the time I do not even understand what they are doing, an ignorance I parade in public for all to see &mdash; well, to listen to in my podcasts. I&rsquo;m no less expressive of my ignorance within the Anahitapolis threads, but am impressed with the graciousness with which I am received nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m starting to &ldquo;click&rdquo; into what these guys are doing! It sure helps that I am using Anahita for real. Using Anahita for real was a leap, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you. Using it, studying it, has given me the hook to figure out where they are coming from. Not to mention a very unique perspective on the Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, remember: I use the Nooku Framework for real every day, at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://southlasallecommerce.com/anahita\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"South LaSalle Commerce uses the Nooku Framework for real!\">SouthLaSalleCommerce.com/Anahita</a>&nbsp;(yes, that really is the URL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just this week, Rastin &amp; Ash started a new podcast using Google+ Hangout. It&rsquo;s at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2011/12/hangout-with-anahita-episode-1/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hangout With Anahita – Episode 1\">http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2011/12/hangout-with-anahita-episode-1/&nbsp;</a>. I&rsquo;ll tell you, I like the format &mdash; sort of a like a news conference after the Leafs lose to the Bruins. So, coach, what about your defence getting caught above the blue line? What is very interesting is the people who were on with Rastin &amp; Ash are subscribers who are active with Anahitapolis.com.. They are not selling anything, and the comments are not always waxing poetically about Anahita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s very ballsy that this podcast was even made public, and I admire Rastin &amp; Ash for their leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What topic was the very first topic of Anahita&rsquo;s very first podcast? Why, it is the Nooku Server and the Nooku Framework! Go listen to it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They plan on discarding the parts of the Nooku Server that do not fit their purposes. Really, go listen to this podcast!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am starting to become convinced that their usage of FOSS is the way to go. Use FOSS as raw material. Shape it into the thing you need it to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think of Joomla this way. I built a demo site for my Club Commerce software, including my Tienda Distro, and I was thinking of Anahita and the new&nbsp;<a href=\"http://squareonecms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Joomla 1.7 Distro by Jeremy Wilkins\">SquareOneCMS Joomla Distro</a>. Take it all in as raw material, shape it, mold it, and create powerful money-making custom software out of it. We&rsquo;re going to have a lot of fun in my new Hackerpreneur Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jamming in Changes to Nooku Framework</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a Nooku Jam in Belgium this past weekend. Torkil Johnsen wrote a fabulous, must-read, blog post about it at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.torkiljohnsen.com/2011/11/28/nooku-jam-leuven-2011/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nooku Jam Leuven 2011\">http://www.torkiljohnsen.com/2011/11/28/nooku-jam-leuven-2011/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Deutsch wrote a post at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111011776153281260419/posts/CGxTt8hYCHA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nooku Jam 2011 in Leuven\">https://plus.google.com/111011776153281260419/posts/CGxTt8hYCHA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a terrific&nbsp;<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/browse_thread/thread/32e557df5996137b#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"BC or not... \">thread within the Nooku Google Group</a>&nbsp;titled &ldquo;B[ackwards] C[ompatible] or not&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My experience enumerated last podcast was talked about significantly at this Nooku Jam. As Torkil&rsquo;s article says:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>After all, a website can&rsquo;t have for instance both&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ninjaforge.com/extensions/ninjaboard\" target=\"_blank\">Ninjaboard</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://app.ohanah.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ohanah</a>&nbsp;installed if they&rsquo;re running different framework versions.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, absolutely!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Nooku will in 2012 introduce 4 month release cycles. First release will be in approximately January 2012, and will be numbered 12.1 (year.release number). That&rsquo;s right: No more alphas, just releases. Second release of 2012 will be 12.2</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This takes my breath away! &ldquo;No more alphas, just releases&rdquo;. An unexpected acknowledgement that there is a never-ending river of changes. The alpha/beta/stable nomenclature expects a terminus of changes that are captured in final form called &ldquo;stable&rdquo;. Then, the cycle renews itself into the next stable version. Except that there was no other stage except &ldquo;alpha&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought that this time it was different in that it was ok to use an alpha version of the Nooku Framework because others were. However, the lesson I learned dispelled the notion that I was using anything other than alpha software. So, lesson learned, stay away until a stable version is released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, there are &ldquo;just releases&rdquo;! It&rsquo;s not about releasing software, it&rsquo;s about Change Management. This is a truer expression of what is happening. How do you manage change? Is there &ldquo;Backward Compatibility&rdquo;? How often are releases released? How do we manage Nooku Framework based Joomla extensions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Torkil made a very astute observation in that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/msg/92fb0ad5ee9ed64d\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Torkil\'s Astute Observation\">Google Group thread</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Consider also that as the framework gradually grows and matures, chances are that changes in upcoming releases should require less refactoring.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Bingo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the profundity of the changes will diminish, even if the number of changes do not, as the conceptual goals are realized into the Framework. With the changes becoming lesser in scope, Change Management will be easier to achieve. At least in theory!<br />\r\nUPDATE (Dec 2, 2011):&nbsp;<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/msg/737d14d3b015ab47\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Release cycle\">Johan added this to the Google Group thread</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>the flow is</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. 0 months : Start release in development branch<br />\r\n2. 4 months : Merge release into trunk<br />\r\n3. 4 months : Tag release</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Total cycle for a release will be 8 months</em>. Since work in trunk and<br />\r\ndevelopment is done at the same time there will be a release every 4<br />\r\nmonths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers can contribute at any point during those 8 months :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash; During development (0 &ndash; 4m) : Developers can contribute new<br />\r\nfeatures, API changes etc<br />\r\n&ndash; During stabilization &nbsp;(4 &ndash; 8m) : Developers can contribute bug<br />\r\nfixes, do testing etc.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Closing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda is ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk technical to me, hoo hoo hoo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hackerpreneur Clubs are the way for users to hold the power of FOSS in their hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I care a great deal about the Nooku Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nooku Jam changes focus of releases onto Change Management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whew!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(46, 82, 3, 'Tbbs42', '<h2>Opening</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to the 42nd &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, December 08th, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Podcast Recordings Crapped Out On Me &mdash; Twice!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;johnny_cash_movie_recording_live_no_swearing_clip1.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recorded not one, but two recordings with Alan Langford, my guest today. The Skype recording software called Pamela did not write the MP3 to disk after both recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shit!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan is very gracious about re-recording, and is being a good sport about a third go-&rsquo;round. This tells you something about his Big Heart beneath the sardonic wit. But I&rsquo;ve overstayed my welcome on this one, so I will compose a fresh show based on what we talked about &mdash; twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sometimes I think Alan Langford Flies Too Low Under the Radar</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you follow Alan on Twitter? No, well you should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/FxNxRL\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Alan Langford on Twitter\">@FxNxRL</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Langford has a long history contributing to the Joomla project. It looks like Joomla 1.7 does not have a file called credits.php, but Joomla 1.5 does. Alan is listed in this credits.php file for all the Joomla releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan leads the Toronto Joomla User Group since forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan&rsquo;s technical skill is considerable. He runs servers as part of his business. He offers unique Joomla extensions for free downloads. His management background is extensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan&rsquo;s foray into servers parallels the extensions he offers for free download: solutions rooted in real-world problems. Spambots harrassing his Joomla user table? Write a little plugin called &ldquo;User Killer&rdquo; &mdash; pretty snazzy name, actually!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frustrated with the webhosts his client sites resided, Alan went through a long and winding road to becoming a first class hosting provider. Alan&rsquo;s newest service is Canadian hosting, which is something my Canadian Club Commerce members should keep in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t put &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; and &ldquo;Club&rdquo; side-by-side lest anyone think I&rsquo;m talking about something else!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SquareOneCMS Joomla Distribution</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://squareonecms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Square 1 Joomla Distro\">SquareOneCMS</a>?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the brainchild of Jeremy Wilken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Y&rsquo;know, Jeremy has no idea I&rsquo;m talking about his Distro. But, I had one question, which is not a criticism, but if I have to even ask myself if something will be interpreted as criticism then that&rsquo;s reason enough. So I emailed Jeremy last night and we&rsquo;re going to do a show next month after his initial SquareOneCMS release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the footer that takes pain to explain that this is not a fork:</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"copy\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Square One is a Joomla distribution. Some people may consider it a fork, which is when software is taken and then independently developed, but this is not the case. Square One is a simplified version of Joomla, but remains 98% Joomla. Almost all of the changes between Joomla and Square One are removing unrequired core extensions of Joomla, and a few minor additions to make it possible to reinstall those extensions.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the idea of Joomla distros. Love it. There should be tons of &lsquo;em, I think the marketplace thirsts for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan installs his own personal Joomla distros on his client sites, which makes complete sense. If you customize and run the server, you have encyclopaedic knowledge of Joomla, and you can program in your sleep, then why not tweak the Joomla you install on servers you lovingly configure?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my first recording with Alan, I confessed that I&rsquo;ve been dense understand Free Open Source Software for a long time. It&rsquo;s a culture shock, and I&rsquo;m now aclimatizing to it. Do you know that this fall I keep going to the GNU.org site and re-reading&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Free Software Definition\">the four freedoms of General Public Licenced software</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:square\">\r\n	<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>\r\n	<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>\r\n	<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>\r\n	<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I harp on this because it is worth harping about: you are entitled!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users of open source software, especially Free Open Source Software, shoulder every risk and every burden of using it. In exchange for shouldering extreme risk, users get extreme control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to get the benefits of this extreme control is to wield it. With FOSS, control is truly a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are entitled to do whatever you want with the code, and then to distribute the code you messed with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is precisely what you are supposed to do. This is what you are meant to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla from Joomla.org is just raw material, baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need more Alans and Jeremys baking the software. All the learning, all the experience, all the wisdom that the Alans and Jeremys of the world have should be imputed into the raw material before the users and consultants use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know why? I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Because the Alans and Jeremys of the world, who devote their love and life&nbsp; and passion to their profession, will mitigate our risk using Free Open Source Software. And given that we-who-use FOSS absorb extreme risk using it, this software intermediation takes away a major layer of operational risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeremy is to be applauded for his ground-breaking Distro. I do not know of any other Joomla Distros out there. To my eyes, Jeremy is setting things up for the long haul, which bodes well for all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt;johnny_cash_movie_hats_off_to_you_clip1.mp3&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My hats off to you, Jeremy! Looking forward to having you on my show, and contributing to your valuable Joomla Distro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the question I had about your Distro that you answered in an email I just received, let&rsquo;s talk about it together next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GitHub README.md file is a terrific description of the SquareOneCMS Distro &mdash; by the way, that&rsquo;s an interesting name for your Distro, I have to remember to ask about it! &mdash; at<a href=\"https://github.com/gnomeontherun/square-one-cms/blob/staging/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SquareOneCMS readme.md on Github\">https://github.com/gnomeontherun/square-one-cms/blob/staging/README.md</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Abivia Content Pattern Plugin (ACP) &ndash; a simple CCK</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked quite a bit about Alan&rsquo;s ACP plugin, availabe at Abivia.net.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACP is a clever Joomla plugin, born of a real-life need, that exploits the way plugins relate to articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have recipes. Each recipe is supposed to be a separate Joomla article. You want the recipe title at the top. The picture to the left. Ingredients listed on top of the instructions. You want the number of servings at the very bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First thing you look for is a component &mdash; or maybe you figure you&rsquo;ll whip up a component. Usually, you just decide to create a separate Joomla article per recipe although you know that somehow your butt&rsquo;s going to be bitten later on. Well, how &rsquo;bout putting Abivia Content Pattern Plugin in your toolbox?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That something that comes back to haunt you is the inevitable layout change. Ingredients and instructions now go side-by-side, not vertically. Instead of modifying 100 recipe articles, you modify the article with the ACP&rsquo;s bracketed words once, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No components, no views, no over-rides. But go ahead, bill a couple of hours anyways!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be spending quality time with ACP to see what it can do with Tienda. ACP has IF..THEN conditional patterns which I want to check out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might get interesting using ACP in the checkout views &mdash; if that&rsquo;s even possible. Maybe it will after I create my own ACP distro!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abivia Content Pattern is free at<a href=\"http://www.abivia.net/products/joomla-extensions/abivia-content-patterns\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Abivia Content Pattern\">http://www.abivia.net/products/joomla-extensions/abivia-content-patterns</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Transcipts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Who convinced me to create transcripts? Yup, Alan did. He reads shows instead of listens to &lsquo;em. I agree, it&rsquo;s faster to scan an article than listen to a full podcast &mdash; although you miss the sound clips!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes me 30 to 45 minutes to proof a 25 minute podcast. I can&rsquo;t just type corrections. Oh no, I have to add notes, links, and tweak formatting for the really profound passages. Sometimes I skip a week of podcasting because the editing adds too much time. For podcasts with no guest, I compose the show first, and then publish my script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcripts are a long-term proposition. Looking back and having a library of podcasts with transcripts is a good thing for SEO, for people who don&rsquo;t listen to podcasts; and, to reference for other shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think being listed in iTunes is important. I think having your own podcast is important. The mobile devices are made for audio and video, and niche ecommerce proprietors should have content for mobile. That content is not the written word! However, it&rsquo;s also important to have the written word as follow-up and for an SEO boost, so podcasting with transcripts is a Good Thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Closing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan thank you for being a guest today &ndash; ha!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good deal: record a podcast, don&rsquo;t use it, then do a monologue show. Twice in a month &mdash; really, it&rsquo;s a coincidence!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

Today is Thursday, December 15th, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recording a flurry of weekly podcasts before taking a break and resuming in the new year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arash Sanieyan and Rastin Mehr join me for our quarterly podcast. How are you today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Doing great thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m good, yeah, just tired a little bit, but other than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s because you guys don&rsquo;t sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;No we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ve been coding day and night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t even know man.&nbsp; I slept actually at 10 last night, then I woke up at 4 and worked from 4 &rsquo;til 8 then went to sleep again for like an hour before the podcast, so um yeah, it&rsquo;s confusing, but a lot of good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Note:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Why programmers work at night\">Why Programmers Work at Night</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t find an appropriate joke for that, but I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re rested. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ash and Rastin are the co-founders and core architect&rsquo;s of the Anahita Social Network.

Players who are on the SI cover mess up the next game?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, after your podcast complimenting my podcasting and preparation, I did minimal prep and suffered technical problems with last week&rsquo;s show with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs42\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Virtual Guest Alan Langford on Joomla Distro, Content Pattern Plugin, and Transcripts\">Alan Langford</a>. I ended up interviewing my first &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; guest which Alan thought was a great idea. Alan is very gracious about the whole thing &mdash; thank you Alan!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ash, Rastin, you started your own podcasts, called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/tag/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anahita Hangout Podcasts\">Hangouts</a>&ldquo;. You&rsquo;ve done two of them already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, Hangouts we just use Google Hangouts on Google Plus and we saw here and there that some developers are actually using Hangout to teach development to people or just hangouts.&nbsp; We saw people hanging out and playing music for each other or doing other things and we thought it would be a good idea that we could<strong>&nbsp;do hangouts with our premium members and answer questions</strong>.&nbsp; So, we just organized one as an experiment and then a lot of people signed up so we had to break it into two sessions and just like that<strong>&nbsp;we recorded the sessions with minimal editing and posted them online</strong>&nbsp;and now we have a podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s nothing as close as your podcast so I mean we sort of figured out that it&rsquo;s actually really hard to have a podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, we started appreciating that<em>&nbsp;this actually takes a lot more work than we thought and all the thought and process and preparation that you do, ours was just hanging out</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;So we sort of like appreciate what you know, the effort that you put into interviewing people.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>mentally, the whole energy everything takes a lot of effort</em>&nbsp;so, but it&rsquo;s a<strong>&nbsp;good way for us to also connect with our premium members</strong>&nbsp;which was great because we are talking with our premium members for the past 8-10 months and then we haven&rsquo;t seen them, like you know, in a live way now we did, so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Here I am admiring you because you&rsquo;re recording these podcasts, these hangouts, I thought that&rsquo;s kind of risky because I was listening to the first one and they weren&rsquo;t exactly criticizing Anahita but you know, it was talking well what about this and what about that, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make Anahita sound the greatest, and I thought this is sort of an insider conversation that you&rsquo;re letting out to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[hat&rsquo;s off clip]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So my hat&rsquo;s off to you for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;<em><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\"><strong>Oh thanks, I think it&rsquo;s better for people to know Anahita as it is rather than creating a squeaky clean glossy image for public</strong></span></em>&nbsp;and no, we try to be as open as possible about Anahita and I know that sounds like a cliche these days, but um, I really honestly didn&rsquo;t think what could possibly go wrong because people ask us questions all the time on the forum and we got accustomed to having questions thrown at us and the worst case scenario we just say &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or if somebody says &ldquo;hey I don&rsquo;t like the way you&rsquo;re doing it&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I think what inspired us was also The Leo Laporte Show this week into&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twit.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"This Week in Tech\">TWIT TV</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Anything called Twit has to be inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well, by the way he has been long before Twitter came around, but Leo Laporte I think he is known as the father of podcasting and he started a very casual format which he basically sat on his exercise ball and called his friends on Skype and he has got really good friends, all of them are people with a lot of good insight, and they talked about tech in a very casual way and they recorded and put it out and this show has been one of the major sources that I get my industry insights and that format is really good I think, because it&rsquo;s very casual, it&rsquo;s very comfortable and what could go wrong? What is the worst that can happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;The thing is for the past, well since we started working, actually I can tell you Rastin inspired me to be like that.&nbsp; Like he sort of set the whole from the beginning set the whole ground that you know, be proud of what you have and&nbsp;<strong>if you don&rsquo;t know it it&rsquo;s not a crime</strong>.&nbsp; You know you can just basically be honest about everything that you do and just be proud of it.&nbsp; So the<strong>&nbsp;hangout was nothing different than what we&rsquo;ve been doing for the past 2-3 years</strong>, I mean, in every aspect of our work.&nbsp; Basically this is what we have, this is what we&rsquo;ve done and we&rsquo;re very proud of it and if you just don&rsquo;t know the answer, well, we&rsquo;ll get back to you later.&nbsp; So that was sort of the hangout, we didn&rsquo;t feel different than any other time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I think one challenge was that I think some members may not feel comfortable with being in the spotlight, we still have some members who don&rsquo;t have uploaded an avatar or they use a pseudonym or they might be in a country or in a position that they don&rsquo;t want their name to be mentioned on the air and the podcasts are public.&nbsp; So there is that issue, so I try to make sure in advance and I think I know the people, the members who are a little more concerned about their privacy, but there are other people who are just more than happy to come and play along, so that&rsquo;s as far as it goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;As far as Leo Laporte, when I did my WordPress site for South LaSalle Media, I was on Leo Laporte all the time seeing how he does it and even looking at the metadata that he has in the MP3&rsquo;s and how he structures it for itunes, something you should look at!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well I&rsquo;m just learning about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I know, there&rsquo;s so many details.&nbsp; There was a New York Times article when I was doing it and he was on the verge of making $3 million a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Wow &ndash; Leo Laporte?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Leo Laporte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;From his podcasts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Here&rsquo;s the article:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/27/technology/27podcast.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Talking Tech and Building an Empire From Podcasts\">Talking Tech and Building an Empire from Podcasts</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, from his empire and one thing that he did I took note, was he doesn&rsquo;t host many of the shows, he hosts his flagship show but a lot of the other ones are from other people which I tried to do with Alan and Derek, it&rsquo;s just so much work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That is true.&nbsp; I think what Leo has done, he set the framework and he set the idea and he really made a process that is very comfortable and very spontaneous, like they even have a chat room on Skype, the people just suggest topics and the people in that circle they are all ready to comment on those topics because they all have good industry insight which is, there is John C. Dvorak<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;I think his position is to make sure that they are doing {indistinct} a lot over a certain topic, so if they are talking a lot about a certain topic he stops them and says &ldquo;okay can you move on now&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think a lot of them came from Ziff Davis or whatever it was called.&nbsp; That made PC Magazine and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Note: Yes, it was Ziff-Davis &ndash;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziff_Davis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ziff-Davis on Wiki\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziff_Davis</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well I know Leo Laporte, I used to listen to their program on TechTV and back then I was computer science student in my little dorm up in Northern BC and for me it was so exciting that I could get technology news over the internet and that was humongous and it was right at the dot com boom era and then apparently they all got laid off from TechTV and they started their own show and so they set the ground for what podcasting how it should be.&nbsp; So he is an inspiration for many people, Leo Laporte and also in the book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Art-Community-Building-Participation-Practice/dp/0596156715\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Art of Community book\">The Art of Community</a>[Amazon link, no affiliate code in the link] he has co-authored it, he&rsquo;s a great guy &ndash; I admire him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;For you, what&rsquo;s different is that you&rsquo;re taking people within your subscribers and you&rsquo;re talking about things that, you know, you talk about within Anahitopolis &mdash; anahita police, somebody said that&rsquo;s how you pronounce it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Actually it rhymes with metropolis, so Anahitopolis &ndash; metropolis &ndash; if you want to know how to pronounce it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;What I found interesting was that it was&nbsp;<strong>inside conversations from insiders that you were broadcasting to the public,</strong>&nbsp;and I thought some of the stuff that you&rsquo;re talking about, they&rsquo;re threads, they&rsquo;re threads within, now I can&rsquo;t pronounce it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;from the discussions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, and I thought it was just,&hellip; but I thought &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right to do this and you&rsquo;re right to do it this way&rdquo;.&nbsp; So another little piece of leadership from you guys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, thanks.&nbsp; We are just doing what we love to do, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s much of leadership, but it&rsquo;s fun.&nbsp; We really enjoy working on Anahita, it&rsquo;s really for us it&rsquo;s like going on a date in a very nerdy and geeky way and we just can&rsquo;t wait to start that time of the day that we sit down with our cup of tea and play Netflix and/or a recent podcast, and code, whether Ash and I are working together or separate, and we interact and answer questions and&nbsp;<strong>interacting with the premium tribe is such a pleasure and they are such a great bunch of people</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s how we actually look at it because the Hangout we weren&rsquo;t looking at &ldquo;oh look at what we are telling people &ndash; it was more like oh we&rsquo;re going to talk to them, we&rsquo;re going to talk to our premium members&rdquo;- it&rsquo;s all about them really when we talk to them and they give us feedback and it&rsquo;s just you know yes, we have our fights with each other, you know we have our arguments, sometimes I win, sometimes they lose, but the whole idea is that it&rsquo;s a friendship really.&nbsp; Yes there are paying customers, tribe members, but at first they are just friends, we are just friends and the Hangout we feel like that, that we&rsquo;re just talking to friends and that felt really good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well you have me on your next Hangout which is this Friday and I have at least one criticism, so, but I emailed you permission and Rastin said it was okay, I thought &ldquo;okay&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Anything because and&nbsp;<strong>we&rsquo;re going to be so brutal and honest about it too</strong>.&nbsp; We put out the facts as they are.&nbsp; One thing about the nerd culture is that we are so good at dealing with facts.&nbsp; No matter how convenient or inconvenient they are &ndash; we deal with them a lot easier because there is that honesty to them.&nbsp; One of the other great things about Open Source is that if you don&rsquo;t agree with an approach you can always do it your own way and you can have a copy, you can build in but once you do something your own way, from that point you have to maintain it yourself too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;What a great lead-in to the next one, I&rsquo;m going to just scamper in un-Canadian style.&nbsp; Because I look at what you&rsquo;re doing and you&rsquo;re running right now a&nbsp;<strong>Hackerpreneur site, a Hackerpreneur Club type site and I think that&rsquo;s how things should be structured now</strong>&nbsp;and there was this&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2011/12/05/the-rise-of-developeronomics/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Rise of Developeronomics\">article in&nbsp;Forbes recently</a>&nbsp;called &ldquo;The Rise of Developer-onomics&rdquo;. &ndash; and&nbsp;I have a blog post about this article at<a href=\"http://www.southlasallecommerce.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=63:hackerprenomics-the-forbes-article\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hackerprenomics: The Forbes Article \">http://www.southlasallecommerce.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=63:hackerprenomics-the-forbes-article.</a>&nbsp;&ndash; telling about the importance of developers that the economic growth comes from developers, this columnist said 16 words:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">the net present value on a strong and positive relationship with a talented developer today is ridiculously high</span></strong>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The NPV on a strong and positive relationship with a talented developer today is ridiculously high&hellip; and you wrote, Rastin, on a blog post earlier this year was called The Myths of Anahita&nbsp; and Myth #5:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">the five keywords about hackerpreneur clubs or have hired hackers in their group</span></strong>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>[I quote Rastin&rsquo;s brilliant blog post about Hackerpreneurs &mdash; actually, he buried it within a blog post &mdash;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs41\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Power, Hackerpreneur, Tienda, Tech Talk, Nooku\">two shows ago</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s actually from you that I realized, you know,&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">Open Source software is raw material</span></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">that you have to take it as your own</span></strong>&nbsp;and that&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\"><strong>if you can&rsquo;t do it, you have to create a group where there&rsquo;s that talent in there so that you can all make it as a group</strong></span>, so I can see what this Tienda Club that I&rsquo;m doing, it&rsquo;s a lot like that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got the distro and all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been a big inspiration.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s seeing what you&rsquo;re doing on the inside of your site how&nbsp;<em>it&rsquo;s not really a support site per se</em>&nbsp;and now this Hangout, I think it&rsquo;s the way to &hellip;.. I can&rsquo;t find the words!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a way for users to really treat their software as an asset and that it&rsquo;s the code that provides the revenue, not just the asset growth but the revenue.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t have the technology you can&rsquo;t make money, you know, from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;I think the best way to put it, like as Rastin&rsquo;s analogy all the time that&nbsp;<strong>Anahitopolis is a Lego Club</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>It&rsquo;s a place that you come and put together things, you don&rsquo;t go buy one product, you go buy Legos that you can put together your Legos together</strong>&nbsp;and at the end of the day you can get to take what you built home. Basically that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing on Anahitopolis is really<strong>&nbsp;teaching people</strong>&nbsp;wherever they are how to put these Legos together, you still have to put them together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Note: The Anahita Distro comes with the Anahita Social Engine and the Apps. It&rsquo;s all ready to go. I&rsquo;ve not begun &ldquo;lego-ing&rdquo;! -Bob]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, we supply all the Lego bricks and we are also nurturing a place for people to learn how to put these building blocks together and build new things and they also share tips with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, and what are you doing differently than in the usual Joomla clubs that I know and love?&nbsp;<strong>You participate directly in all the discussions, you&rsquo;re accessible &ndash; that&rsquo;s where you &ldquo;hangout&rdquo; in your site.&nbsp; Dealing with you two, not with you know, first level support.&nbsp; And I found that to be quite different.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well, the hangout term is really a Google, it&rsquo;s the name of their technology but it is truly a hangout because everyone talks about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;When I have trouble with a template and I say you know, how does this part of the framework work or something, you know the people who program it aren&rsquo;t really the people going to respond to me, they respond to me all timely, we go through a dance because I know what they&rsquo;re doing, they&rsquo;re playing their games to try to get rid of me.&nbsp; Half the time that&rsquo;s what support feels like, but that&rsquo;s not the Hackerpreneur Club feel from you in your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s totally different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the nature of a social network Bob, you know<strong><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">everybody will see what you&rsquo;re doing, there&rsquo;s a difference between a ticketing system or things like that.</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly. [BINGO!]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Giving support within a social network, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a support, it feels more like a help.&nbsp; It feels like coaching and problem solving and you do what you can and if you can&rsquo;t contribute more &ndash; other people will help you.&nbsp; Like in our case, there were cases that I didn&rsquo;t know &ndash; I&rsquo;m the guy that built it and didn&rsquo;t know the answer and I know somebody else from the community &ndash; tribe members come and answer the questions, they had a better perspective than me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s because they sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Probably yeah [laughter].&nbsp; You know, that&rsquo;s the thing, we lack sleep but we have people that help us, so we did the best thing.&nbsp; We have a platform that allows everybody to participate and that&rsquo;s basically the whole nature of a social network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">I think that is a key issue that using a social network to deliver support, we are learning it is clearly superior than a ticketing model.</span></strong>&nbsp; A ticketing model is not as scaleable and it&rsquo;s not very human although<strong>&nbsp;it takes a special type of client or customer as our audience to get used to the social networking environment</strong>, which I think we are getting more and more of them.&nbsp; A lot of people are now Facebook users, Twitter users &ndash; they are very comfortable of communicating in that fashion and helping other people is all about communication.&nbsp; So when you have an environment that puts communication on steroids then quality of help goes higher and it gets a lot easier and more scaleable as well because Ash and myself we are two people, we code and we also have to answer questions, we also monitor what the community thinks, even when people publish a page on their own profile and talk about the features they like to have or about the problems they are dealing with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>It allows us to have a general idea what everybody has in mind and how we can help them out or so.&nbsp; It is truly a great way of delivering service and support and collecting feedback from people.&nbsp; We are trying to become a role model on tha</strong>t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well you are, I note your leadership &ndash; you can see with my Club Commerce&nbsp; that just like we looked at Leo Laporte for how somebody who has done it and I look at you and also I see the way you&rsquo;re doing it as The Way to do it as a Hackerpreneur Club versus just like pure support, running a forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s true and we have to encourage more developers &ndash; what is a Hackerpreneur? A Hackerpreneur first is a hacker, someone who comes with<strong><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">&nbsp;creative solutions to problems and they are entrepreneurs</span></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; they are in it to build a business and building a business is more than about just making money, it&rsquo;s about the world liberation, it&rsquo;s about making a difference, it&rsquo;s about an expression, it&rsquo;s about gaining, empowering yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m so modest in my ambitions compared to you. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well you put those together and that&rsquo;s where Hackerpreneur is coming in and they are the new breed of entrepreneurs and the new breed of hackers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You said they&rsquo;re the Deadliest Warriors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;They are by order of magnitudes more competitive to the point that, like last year so many newsletters and messages and blog posts that I&rsquo;ve read, everybody was so desperate about that technical cofounder and as software is eating the world.&nbsp; The importance of developers is increasing and hackers and developers,&nbsp;<strong>hackers are those developers who can make a difference</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; they are like magicians.&nbsp; They write down symbols and change the world and for a lot of them learning business is a lot easier than for the business person to learn to become a hacker, and we&rsquo;ve had the hackerpreneurs in the history &ndash; we look at Facebook and WordPress and Apple Computers and Google and all of these the founders were hackerpreneurs.&nbsp; I think in the Open Source world right now we have a rise of Hackerpreneurs coming in the domain of mobile development, like Instagram was founded by two hackerpreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s actually still run by two people, maybe they have like some community managers but there are two developers only, two or maybe three at most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;A lot of Hackerpreneurs they decide to work for themselves and build their own business, they raise, they make their own money, they don&rsquo;t need the business person because for them it is a lot easier to learn the business skills and therefore they are so intimidating.&nbsp; When you go to the local start up events or you go to the gatherings and you see this tension between them because up to now it was the business person that buys developers, they buy scientists &ndash; it&rsquo;s been even in our pop culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You look at so many movies that there is the mad scientist begging the investor &ldquo;give me money so that I can finish my time machine&rdquo; but now the mad scientist is the investor as well or they come up with innovative ways to generate funds that no business person could come up with because they just think differently</strong>, the hackers they shoot curve balls &ndash; they have rewritten the rules of business and that is the new competitive force that is going to be in the technology market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re at a half hour and you are more comfortable podcasting than when we first started this. [laughter] Well done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This Friday &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. sorry, my cold got me.&nbsp; Ash and Rastin will be recording their third Hangout this Friday, December 16th and I&rsquo;ll be there for my first Hangou,t and Ash and Rastin, thank you for being on my show. Much appreciate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re welcome, thank you for having us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like the fastest half hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;We actually enjoy being on this show every time you ask us &ndash; it&rsquo;s just fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;You are the inspiration for podcasting in our community right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(48, 84, 3, 'Tbbs44', '<p>Welcome to the 44th &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Thursday, January 05th. My first podcast of this New Year 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toughest thing about podcasting is podcasting regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, I will publish podcasts with guests on the second and fourth Thursday of the month. We will record on the Wednesday prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each podcast&nbsp; &mdash; planning, recording, post-production, uploading and transcript proofing &mdash; is 4 to 6 hours, which still shocks me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first and third, and sometimes fifth, Thursday of the month is reserved for my &ldquo;bully pulpit&rdquo; podcasts, Anahita style &ldquo;Hangouts&rdquo;, and just plain taking the week off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each podcast will have transcripts. This year I will source two ongoing transcript sponsors to defray the cost of transcriptions. My fallback service is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.blogtalkradio.com/transcription.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Blog Talk Radio\'s transcription service\">BlogTalkRadio</a>, who charges $75 per half hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My podcasts were to resume next week. Ah, but work does intrude, the holidays are over for me! I am forking Tienda, and a podcast is in order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Software Fork Wiki Definition\">wiki definition of project fork</a>&nbsp;is:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a legal copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct piece of software. The term implies not merely a development branch, but a split in the developer community, analogous to a religious schism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Free and open source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission without violating any copyright law.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no &ldquo;religious schism&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s continue with the wiki&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Free and open source software may be legally forked without the approval of those currently managing a software project or distributing the software, per the definitions of &ldquo;free software&rdquo; (&ldquo;Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits&rdquo;) and &ldquo;open source&rdquo; (&ldquo;3. Derived Works: redistribution of modifications must be allowed. (To allow legal sharing and to permit new features or repairs.)&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking. The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe other software forks rate a reality show, but nothing of the sort is happening here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will tell you what I told a Founding Member of my Club Commerce earlier this week: Tienda&rsquo;s development seems to have stalled. It&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;ve heard, it&rsquo;s what I see. It&rsquo;s almost as if Tienda&rsquo;s development has plateaued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I told him that Tienda is not exactly capturing peoples&rsquo; imagination. The Tienda public forum has no activity. There&rsquo;s no third party vendor action. The last official blog post about Tienda was to announce that the holidays are coming, which seems to affirm my general perception. There is zero tweeting, which, frankly, shocks me. Little blogging, no tweeting &mdash; hello, is anyone home?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just before Christmas, I posted a question in the projects site asking what is happening with Tienda and Joomla 2.5. The reply, from Chris Paschen, was &ldquo;we will have a blog post about this in a few weeks&rdquo;. Joomla 2.5 will be out before this blog post?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve already journied through various Joomla and non-Joomla carts. Naturally, I did a podcast about it, called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs39\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Why I Came Home To Joomla &amp; Tienda\">Why I came home to Joomla and Tienda</a>&ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I&rsquo;m sticking with Tienda. And if that means taking on the responsibility of developing it, then so be it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not without a healthy dose of trepidation, and with vast respect for the effort that has gone into Tienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As forks go, mine will go down in history as the friendliest fork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, after getting my LaSalleMart domain, setting up my LaSalleMart Twitter account and Facebook page, creating a one page website with an awful logo, I talked to Chris Paschen for 2 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris is what I call &ldquo;The Public Face&rdquo; of Dioscouri, because he is blogging, tweeting, and moderating the public forum and projects site. Chris is an independent consultant, his site is own site is<a href=\"http://paschencommunications.com/\">PaschenCommunications.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no arguing. No ranting. No raving. No personal animosities. No &ldquo;philosophical differences&rdquo;. There is no &ldquo;parting of the ways&rdquo; either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda development needs an infusion of energy. I sense some burn-out &ndash; two years of development has taken its toll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda may be open source, but its development process is completely closed off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris tells me that all sorts of things have been discussed, but I can tell you this: there&rsquo;s no venue where I can participate in those discussions. The most interaction seems to be the ability to vote on feature requests &mdash; you know something, get real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a former life, I was a business analyst. I&rsquo;ve been in meetings where features you think are straight forward are argued fiercely behind closed doors. So much for getting quick sign-offs. I guess we&rsquo;re supposed to post our opinons in the Redmine issue tickets. Yeah, but what about the juicy internal discussions that are going on? That&rsquo;s where I want to be!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, this habit of releasing new features and begging me to test them is not working. And it will never work. You know why? Because I&rsquo;m not part of the feature development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the features being developed are fetishes being pursued to promote the narrow interests of whoever is throwing money at that feature development. I mean, really, I should be contemplating removing features in my Tienda Distro? Well, they are not really features anyways, they are customizations.&nbsp; The downside of dominant sponsorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which speaks to the brutish reality of Tienda development: money!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FSvlyVjl4u4\" width=\"420\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly all the code is created by programmers who are getting paid. Testing is usually the unfunded part, as the money is targeted to direct coding. When funding is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, development becomes customization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a small extension grows into a modest extension, it&rsquo;s easy to maintain that extension. Stay up late, funnel some client money into creature features and general upgrades. Sell some support subscriptions even.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When an ambitious extension grows into a monolithic monster sized extension, staying up late adding features, funnelling client money &mdash; well, those things just don&rsquo;t work anymore. One little screw-up in the code and whatever money you tucked away for a new creature feature is gone into the money pit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tienda is in the Hackerpreneur Zone now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hackerpreneurs who use Tienda have enormous power and influence over Tienda&rsquo;s development. Tienda&rsquo;s code base is a beautiful thing, and it&rsquo;s Tienda&rsquo;s code that the Hackerpreneurs who use Tienda want to build on. But, the first thing the consultants and site owners who use Tienda must do is control Tienda&rsquo;s development. That time has come. We, the Hackerpreneurs who use Tienda, will not invest money, time or effort in a development process we do not control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s control it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s clean up the bugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s delete the half-baked features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s clean up some of the views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get Tienda to a version 1.0, and then let&rsquo;s step on the gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s call it LaSalleMart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, let&rsquo;s do it within my Club Commerce. Where you pay a nominal monthly fee to support my work. Where you know that your fellow Members are serious about progressing LaSalleMart, and are contributing to its development. An open website with no paywall is only going to lead to a website of takers, not givers. Not effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to take the leap of faith and join my Club Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how I&rsquo;m leading development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get in the Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything about LaSalleMart&rsquo;s development will be discussed within my Club&rsquo;s Discussion site by those who are involved. The tone is different when people are involved, and when you know the people are involved. The tone is different when you start becoming familiar with your fellow Members. When you realize the skills and experience of your fellow Members, you start floating solutions, not problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://anahitapolis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anahitapolis.com, Home of the Anahita Social Engine\">Anahitapolis.com</a>&nbsp;has had a profound effect on me: that&rsquo;s where the principals hang out. I can post a real question within the site knowing that Rastin or Ash will chime in. I never ask, &ldquo;is anybody home&rdquo;. Home? That&rsquo;s where they live. Plus, they blog. Plus, they are tweeting constantly. Plus, they now have bi-weekly podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will never have to wonder where I am. I lead from the front. I am on my Club&rsquo;s Discussion site. And that confidence you have knowing I will respond, and the confidence knowing that you have the attention of your fellow Members, will change your attitude. You will take an extra moment to paste a piece of code. You will take that extra moment to include a URL for everyone to reference. That&rsquo;s because you feel confident, not frustrated, by your participation. You will start posting solutions, not problems. It&rsquo;s subtle. And it&rsquo;s glorious!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, I use Anahita for my Discussion site. And you are going to get frustrated by it. A new version of Anahita is on the way, I have an idea of the modifications I want to make, I follow the Anahita Discussions. And when the time comes to upgrade to the new Anahita, and when the time comes to modify our Anahita site to suit our needs, I am confident like I&rsquo;ve never been confident about any Joomla extension. When I come across a problem, I can take the proper time to post the code I have with my questions and I know Rastin and Ash, and the growing number of Anahita-literate Members will help me. It&rsquo;s not support about how to use a program. It&rsquo;s more than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs43\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hackerprenomics with Ash and Rastin\">My recent podcast with Rastin &amp; Ash of Anahitapolis.com</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to form a Leadership Team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to put the Tienda code onto GitHub and use Assembla. We should have administrators. Perhaps these administrators should be especially notified of Discussions in the certain Discussion Groups. Maybe have some overlap to maximize responsiveness. I have wild ideas about &ldquo;builds&rdquo; and &ldquo;test&rdquo; and &ldquo;distros&rdquo; that have implications for how we organize our project. I want to organize &mdash; surprise! &mdash; at least a monthly podcast as a way to present updates to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should have discuss using&nbsp;<a href=\"http://campfirenow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Campfire for private real time chat\">Campfire&nbsp;</a>or something like that, funded by my monthly Club subscriptions. We should talk about this within my Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have very definite opinions about how to proceed with development. I know that talking to my Members we&rsquo;ll come up with a workable plan that is better than what I&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that it&rsquo;s important to work with Dioscouri. If we decide that Club Commerce and Dioscouri will jointly release Tienda version 1.0, then that would be a thrilling moment. There&rsquo;s so much post-version 1.0 development to get into, the work ahead is so vast, that I see collaboration as a permanent thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What underlies collaboration is a strong, vibrant Club Commerce at full Membership. A Membership that uses the software it creates to power a growing portfolio of successful Joomla ecommerce sites. A Membership that is trained on the software that comes out of Club Commerce, whose Members serve the public with the software my Club creates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of you sitting on the sidelines about my Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallecommerce.com/index.php?option=com_acctexp&amp;view=subscribe&amp;Itemid=186\" title=\"Join Club Commerce\">JOIN</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goto SouthLaSalleCommerce dot com.

(49, 85, 3, 'Tbbs45', '<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome to the 45th &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is Thursday, January 12th, 2012, my first podcast of 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeremy Wilken is a first time guest, and my first guest of this new year. Thanks for being here, Jeremy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for inviting me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Today is part one of a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/tbbs46\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jeremy Wilken\'s SquareOne Joomla Distribution, Part 2 of 2\">two part</a>&nbsp;podcast with Jeremy.&nbsp; I think Jeremy&rsquo;s doing something very wonderful, putting a lot of effort into a Joomla distro and what is a Joomla distro?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Well that&rsquo;s a tough question, some people will disagree slightly on what exactly a distribution is.&nbsp; Distro means distribution first off, but there is other terms known as forks, and distributions are kind of the two big terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A distribution is, in my definition, is where you take a piece of software and you alter it within the same confines of what the software currently exists in, so you keep it within compatibility, you keep it along the same lines &ndash; you make tweaks of course, you make changes, you maybe add some stuff, you can remove some stuff, but you&rsquo;re keeping it in the spirit of the original project and you&rsquo;re keeping a lot of the compatibility so that they are fully able to work with one another. So, if someone knows one project and they know your distribution, chances are there should be little to no resistance getting to know it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand a fork would be taking software and you might still continue to develop in the same original spirit but you&rsquo;re breaking ties to that original project and you&rsquo;re not just with the code but with your philosophy and your communications.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s taking the project and instead of starting from scratch you&rsquo;re taking something that exists and starting with that down your own path.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s to me the biggest thing &ndash; the difference between the two and really where I think a distribution fits into the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Your Square One Joomla Distro the url is<a href=\"http://squareonecms.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Square One CMS Joomla Distro\">SquareOneCMS.org</a>&nbsp;and at the bottom you describe that we&rsquo;re not a fork, we&rsquo;re a Distro and we&rsquo;re keeping the integrity of Joomla.&nbsp; My question is: when Joomla updates, do those updates get into your Distro?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Well, when we talk about Joomla updates there are sort of two methods there.&nbsp; Jo0mla updates through the update manager inside of the system when you log in to the administrator, go to the extensions manager and hit update, that information actually has been rewritten, well not rewritten, but it&rsquo;s pointing to a different update system.&nbsp; So Square One has its own now which is essentially the same except for the files point to the Square One versions of the files.&nbsp; So that means when you update inside of Square One you will be getting the package versions of Square One, not of Joomla and the other aspect of that is through the actual code updates which are done through&nbsp;<a href=\"http://github.com/square-one-cms\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"GitHub.com/Square-One-CMS\">GitHub</a>&nbsp;and all that code is stuff that I&rsquo;m managing on the side, most people don&rsquo;t need to think or worry about that, but for the person using the software it will seem very much the same process as Joomla when you update the patches will be applied automatically, but&nbsp; the process will actually include fixes to Joomla and Square One in that update package but that will be managed by me separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think going to your Git Hub &ndash; github.com/square-one-cms &ndash; is great, it&rsquo;s great to go through all the commits and all the notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Actually I find it very very helpful in understanding what you&rsquo;re doing.&nbsp; I think your most favourite word is remove. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Up to now it&rsquo;s been a big one, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Remove&rdquo; and &ldquo;clean&rdquo;, and I thought well if and when I use your Distro, I&rsquo;ve always wondered where the updates come from, so when I see that there&rsquo;s an update in Joomla then I should wait for your update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Correct.&nbsp; So you will never, if you use Square One, you will always go to Square One either to the website or the update system to get updates or fixes.&nbsp; They will, since we&rsquo;re based on Joomla it&rsquo;s going to include a lot of the fixes that Joomla has but you will still see everything centralized in one place and that&rsquo;s to keep it clean otherwise there could be conflicts.&nbsp; So, for example, if you took Square One and had it on your website and then you applied the Joomla patches on top of it instead of the Square One patches, there is some stuff that&rsquo;s different, that if it&rsquo;s not accommodated for, could break your site.&nbsp; Or for example, if you&rsquo;ve removed certain extensions and it tries to update them, it&rsquo;s going to throw an error because it doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.&nbsp; So Square One will separate those packages out and make it possible so that only the pieces that are relevant are being reapplied in the fixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Because the updates, a lot of the updates apply to parts of Joomla that you are removing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Correct, so in, I was just looking at this the other day and it hit&nbsp; me that a lot of the work in the betas has been related to only two or three extensions.&nbsp; So the new smart search component has had a lot of commits and as well as some of the other additions.&nbsp; So a lot of the focus of the Joomla code goes towards, not towards what I&rsquo;m considering the core but to the optional extensions, I should explain what that means maybe in a moment.&nbsp; But to the extensions that I consider optional and that I&rsquo;ve removed from Square One &ndash; that&rsquo;s where a lot of the attention actually ends up going just because that&rsquo;s where a lot of code is &ndash; it makes sense, especially when something is new.&nbsp; So for example, if Joomla comes out with 2.5.0 and then release 2.5.1 however many weeks later &ndash; there may not be any issues related to Square One.&nbsp; It might be only related to the extensions, it is unlikely there&rsquo;s probably a good chance that no matter what, I&rsquo;ll still need to provide a release but once in a while especially as the Joomla gets more and more stable after each release, like 1.5 right now, it hasn&rsquo;t seen an update in months, it&rsquo;s not having the reports for quite some time and the last five or six updates to 1.5 have been fairly minor.&nbsp; So over time, those fixes and changes may not be completely necessary for both systems because I&rsquo;ve removed pieces and Joomla still has them so Joomla would need them but maybe not Square One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You know what I love about what you&rsquo;re doing? You&rsquo;re saying I&rsquo;m just going to take it and I&rsquo;ve got a vision of what I want it to be and I&rsquo;m just going to do it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to ask them to take out stuff from the core, I&rsquo;m just going to do it myself and see how it goes.&nbsp; I think more people should express their vision that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Sure and I have asked, I&rsquo;ve talked about it I&rsquo;ve raised it in discussions several times and a lot of times I&rsquo;m met with resistance and there&rsquo;s resistance about what people need and what people want.&nbsp; Do people expect this to be there, do people need this, what are we going to do if we take it out?&nbsp; How do we ease users into that transition? And it comes down to what you believe to be the truth as far as how users handle things and we don&rsquo;t really know anyways how everyone uses Joomla but the only way for me to express my full vision is to actually go out and prove what it is and prove that it can work and if it&rsquo;s not accepted by some people that&rsquo;s the way, that&rsquo;s how software is.&nbsp; Some people choose Joomla, some people don&rsquo;t and some people will choose Square One and some people won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But it will be the vision that I have laid out and it will still be based on the software that I know&nbsp;<strong>and base my living around but, it will be an alternative view of how it could be done</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well what you&rsquo;re doing publicly is what people do privately.&nbsp; Like sometimes I&rsquo;ll go to the database and I&rsquo;ll just remove the menu link to banners and those so that the client doesn&rsquo;t see them, so I don&rsquo;t have to have questions on it and it doesn&rsquo;t look cluttered.&nbsp; But the fact that you&rsquo;re doing it publicly for everybody to use I think it&rsquo;s great and I applaud you for the effort and you&rsquo;re first.&nbsp; But my question is: why do it for the public, why have such a massive effort?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">You know, that&rsquo;s a good question, and originally I just did it on my own.&nbsp; The whole thing started with,&nbsp;<strong>they put Joomla on GitHub</strong>&nbsp;and that was my doorway really.&nbsp; It was the opportunity that provided me using Git versus Subversion, which is a separate topic, but basically the advantages of using a service like GitHub made a lot more things possible that were much trickier or technically more, just take more work.&nbsp; So now I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<strong>able to basically take Joomla</strong>&nbsp;and I sat down with it and I said well I just want to get rid of a bunch of things and see what happens, I spent a couple of hours just seeing what would happen and seeing if it was a good idea or not and it seemed to be working out.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">A lot of the extensions, they were already set up so they could be quickly removed and in fact almost all of them are made available separately now so I was able to extract them from Joomla and then package them separately so if you want banners, well you can still reinstall it and I found that out over one night and a lot of the reason that I&rsquo;ve put it together in that start was it made me think well I can make a light version of Joomla, but then I realized that there&rsquo;s more than that there.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something here that other people can benefit from.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 0)\">If I were to do this on my own always in the quiet, there would really be no reason for me to do what I&rsquo;m doing, I would just basically fork Joomla and make my own little copy of it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a very different philosophy and if it was just for me then it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if I broke a compatibility with something as long as the things I needed, worked.&nbsp; But my desire was to actually improve hopefully, be able to provide back to Joomla improve things backwards so if I make an improvement and Joomla&rsquo;s management says you know that&rsquo;s a great idea or I offer it to them or however that works, if I make an improvement they should be free to take it and it should work and at this point in time everything should be fairly well synced.&nbsp; So, I keep it open and public because Joomla is that way so I&rsquo;m keeping in the same strategy as Joomla being open source, well it has to be open source as I&rsquo;m keeping the same license, I&rsquo;m keeping it open and available, there&rsquo;s no reason to charge for it because there&rsquo;s nothing in it outside of some tweaks that I&rsquo;ve made that are new.&nbsp; A lot of it is pretty much Joomla &ndash; 98% of it is still very much the same original stuff and the few things that I&rsquo;ve changed are only to improve or enhance or add a little bit of functionality that&rsquo;s missing.&nbsp; So charging for that 1) doesn&rsquo;t seem right, 2) if I want to get help I would like to build a community where people are active in helping to develop, improving things and those kind of things can also be offered back into Joomla.&nbsp; If I did this all privately you wouldn&rsquo;t have any of those opportunities, it would just be me kind of doing my own thing whenever I went with it was fine but this way it keeps me also more accountable to a vision, it keeps me more accountable to progress and if it&rsquo;s in public it could benefit a lot of people.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like you&rsquo;re kind of bringing a practice out of the closet, because so many people I know tweak Joomla before they put it on a site, in some way.&nbsp; But you have it in public, you have a website and there&rsquo;s a few people that are helping you.&nbsp; I think that it would be great to use your SquareOneCMS and then on top of that I have ideas of what I want to do with it.&nbsp; But I thought you should charge for it because it is a value added, and you&rsquo;re maintaining the updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Well sure, there&rsquo;s some work involved with that and I&rsquo;ve always spent time helping out with Open Source projects, it&rsquo;s not always consistent in any way, how or where or when, but it&rsquo;s always been a part of my process because so much of what I know and what I do is based on it and so it&rsquo;s only fitting that I spend some of my energy to keep it going, improve it, help out where I can, so charging for SquareOne doesn&rsquo;t fit with my vision.&nbsp; If I were to develop customized extensions that do really crazy things, you know whatever possibilities there might be, those could be separate things I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not to that point, right now I&rsquo;m thinking that it&rsquo;s far more likely that it will be sustained through a community than by through finances.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s no real financial incentive that I can see at the moment to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I thought maybe doing your Distro would help you in your own consulting, so is that where there&rsquo;s a good payoff for you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like you kind of do it anyways so if you formalize it, it helps you with the other things you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Well sure and I&rsquo;ll start using it as soon as I have the stable version.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not out officially yet, so people haven&rsquo;t had a chance to really play with it yet.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a few people I know who installed one of the test versions but it&rsquo;s still not quite stable because it&rsquo;s being based off of Joomla 2.5 which is not stable yet either, so until that happens, you know, we&rsquo;re still kind of waiting calling in the bug fixes and things as we go.&nbsp; So the ability to get I guess what you say client work perhaps from it, yeah that&rsquo;s possible I suppose.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more of a if it&rsquo;s something that I can focus on and do well that I know will always open more relationships, more opportunities it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they&rsquo;re business or not.&nbsp; Most of my business is based on the relationships that I have established over the years, most of them through Joomla, so those relationships often are what support my business in some way or another either through referrals or actual direct work, so I spend a lot of time with those relationships and I think SquareOne&rsquo;s also kind of a way to show and further develop some of those relationships as well and maybe make some new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well put.&nbsp; Well, yes it&rsquo;s, I certainly saw what you were doing and was very interested, and I had not seen anyone use it and I loved how you were using GitHub, I thought you were really paving the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;As far as I know it&rsquo;s the first, well as far as Joomla goes, it&rsquo;s the only one that I&rsquo;m aware of that&rsquo;s being done in the fashion that I&rsquo;m doing it as far as taking the CMS and then keeping as much compatibility as possible, making some tweaks and still making it available and there&rsquo;s some other distributions or forks out there that have different philosophies, so yes it&rsquo;s been a bit of a<strong>&nbsp;learning curve too because&nbsp; there&rsquo;s no manual on this and sometimes I don&rsquo;t know the right process to do something so I have to make it up as I go and for the most part things have gone pretty well, but once in a while I have to go back and revert my changes or look up new Git commands to figure out a new fancy way to accomplish some task</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I love that, I mean the leadership and the example, but also Joomla 2.5&rsquo;s not out yet, the final &ndash; so you have to figure things out as you go and yes in using GitHub I think that&rsquo;s very important everybody and you&rsquo;re tweeting as well as you go along and I could see how you&rsquo;re progressing and then you added more branches and it&rsquo;s beautiful.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Well it&rsquo;s a matter of management and at the moment being on my own kind of helps keep things a little bit internal I can focus a lot better, I know what&rsquo;s being done if things are to get distributed out into a larger group of people helping to maintain, then again I&rsquo;ll have to adapt and learn how to manage the team or get a team to help manage themselves and it&rsquo;s going to be a learning process throughout, but considering that it&rsquo;s been really about two months that I&rsquo;ve really been focusing on this as a possibility of being an Open Source project and a distribution of Joomla, there&rsquo;s been a lot of interest but until it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s sort of that Catch-22 where people are not quite ready to take it seriously until it&rsquo;s ready for them to be able to use for sure and so it&rsquo;s been a lot more work getting to that point, I think once we get there we&rsquo;ll see a lot of exciting things happen I think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it&rsquo;s just more like Joomla&rsquo;s 2.5 isn&rsquo;t out yet, but you took the right time to get into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to close off Part One now, even though we&rsquo;re a little early and get into some other things in Part Two, so we won&rsquo;t get interrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Alright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Jeremy, thank you for being on my show today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(50, 86, 3, 'Tbbs46', '<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome to the 46th &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;.&nbsp; My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, January 19th, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeremy Wilken is a first time guest, and my first guest of this new year. Thanks for being here, Jeremy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for inviting me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp; Today is the second of a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/tbbs45\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jeremy Wilken\'s SquareOne Joomla Distribution, Part 1 of 2\">two part</a>&nbsp;podcast with Jeremy.&nbsp; The first was last week on January 12th and we&rsquo;re talking about Jeremy&rsquo;s new Joomla Distro called Square One CMS at<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/squareonecms.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"squareonecms.org\">squareonecms.org</a>&nbsp;and it is a distro of Joomla 2.5 which may or may not be out, I think it&rsquo;s supposed to come out on the 24th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; It shouldn&rsquo;t be out until the 24th &ndash; that&rsquo;s the target date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Jeremy is the first Joomla Distro that I&rsquo;ve seen and he&rsquo;s using&nbsp;<a href=\"http://github.com/square-one-cms\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Square One CMS on Github\">GitHub.com</a>&nbsp;and he has a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://squareone.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SquareOne.com\">separate website</a>.&nbsp; What I love about GitHub is I can see clearly all the branches and I can see all the commit messages, this is very helpful to see what he&rsquo;s working on.&nbsp; I see the words &ldquo;remove&rdquo; and &ldquo;clean&rdquo; in a lot of the messages and a lot of what you&rsquo;re doing is removing and cleaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;um hum.&nbsp; Yes, that&rsquo;s been a big part of the initial part of the project.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s sort of what Phase One of Square One is.&nbsp; That sounds a little funny, but the initial release is about stripping it down quite a bit.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not just because it&rsquo;s intended to remove a bunch of things but for the actual<strong>&nbsp;goal which is to make it a good solid foundation to become a base for other people to make distributions of Joomla on top of Square One</strong>, hence the name as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Returning to Square One.&nbsp; I thought that, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t say this, I thought well maybe he&rsquo;s a little frustrated with what comes out of Joomla and he wants to improve it, but I thought 2011 was a year of realization for me that the GPL means can take the code and do something with it and wielding that power of changing the code is about the biggest upside that there is to shoulder all the other risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&rsquo;ve come up with a new term called Intermediation and I want to see more people do it and I think what you&rsquo;re doing is vital &ndash; you&rsquo;re taking Joomla and you&rsquo;re cleaning, you&rsquo;re removing, you&rsquo;re doing some very important&nbsp;<strong>intermediation</strong>&nbsp;so I have a feeling I&rsquo;m pretty sure what I&rsquo;m going to get from you is going to be just a cut better, especially for what I want to do, than just taking it raw from Joomla &ndash; somebody with another set of eyes and ears.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very good at interviewing myself but I wanted to get this across.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard so many people say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t install Joomla, I install my own little thing of Joomla for my clients because I know where I want to make those improvements&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love what you&rsquo;re doing is that kind of intermediation is out there and you&rsquo;ll be a place where people can maybe either better express what they do themselves or take what you&rsquo;re doing and do a little more tweaking before it gets on a client site.&nbsp; So I think what you&rsquo;re doing is great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;I hope that it&rsquo;s available for people to use it in that way that yes I know a lot of people will essentially build out a Joomla install, they&rsquo;ll add the things that they always need, they&rsquo;ll use a tool like Akeeba BackUp, zip it up and then they&rsquo;ve got basically a starting point for the rest of their sites, and that&rsquo;s one possibility for the usage of Square One is, instead of having to go through all of that and then every time you deploy your site you&rsquo;ve still got to go in and make sure you&rsquo;ve updated all your extensions because you might have done it two months ago, so you&rsquo;ve got to keep track of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Square One will actually make that possible to get the latest versions right away from the start</strong>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not actually having to deploy or set up your own copy of everything beforehand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;In Part 1 you used a term called &ldquo;Optional Extensions&rdquo;; and, I thought &ldquo;well, in the Joomla core it can&rsquo;t possibly be optional if it&rsquo;s in the core of Joomla&rdquo;, so what do you mean by that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, and that&rsquo;s a foundational part of what Square One is and why it&rsquo;s going in the direction it is.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;m considering a core extension and what I&rsquo;m considering an optional extension boils down to the definition of if you can remove it and Joomla still functions then it&rsquo;s probably optional in the sense of you cannot remove the user manager because then you would have no way to manage your users which means you couldn&rsquo;t log in and the whole system would fall.&nbsp; On the other hand banners, not everyone needs banners so if you installed it 95% of websites, I don&rsquo;t know how many, but whatever percentage of websites that are built with Joomla that you don&rsquo;t use banners, you wouldn&rsquo;t know that it was gone and if you use banners, there also are alternatives, or you can still reinstall it in the case of Square One, you can still get back but, so the definition to me is largely whether or not it is required for the system itself to function, and if it&rsquo;s missing or if other extensions rely or build upon that functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;What do you mean &ldquo;you can get it back&rdquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;When I say you can get it back, now one of the improvements I have made in Square One is it&rsquo;s possible when you log in and if you were to take the beta now and install it, if you go to the extension manager you&rsquo;ll notice there are some changes there and that&rsquo;s where most of the changes have been made and you&rsquo;ll see the install screen where you normally have install package as a zip, upload it, you know &ndash; those three areas, it&rsquo;s going to be different now, there&rsquo;s still those options but then there&rsquo;s a list underneath it of all the supported extensions in Square One which are the removed extensions that I have removed from the core of Joomla, you can select any of them, hit install and it will reinstall any of those missing features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Wow.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;re not losing anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;If you wanted to you could reinstall every single thing that was removed and have Joomla.&nbsp; In fact you could do that and then you could start and if you just copied Joomla back on top of Square One you&rsquo;d have exactly the same as Joomla and it would still work just fine.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how compatible Square One and Joomla is, because I&rsquo;ve done this, I&rsquo;ve tested it just to see if it worked and it does and there&rsquo;s only one change you have to make and that&rsquo;s change the update system to link to the Joomla files instead of Square One and after that everything should function.&nbsp; So, you&rsquo;ll be able to reacquire or reinstall, it&rsquo;s not reinstall, you&rsquo;ll be able to install any of those extensions that have been removed and you can mix and match whatever combination you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m thinking, now if there&rsquo;s a Joomla update for banners your Square One update doesn&rsquo;t have the update part for banners so how do I get the update for banners?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">So the way that it will work is that in Joomla if banners has an update it&rsquo;s just included as part of the Joomla update itself, the whole thing.&nbsp; So, the Joomla updates might include something for banners, they might include something for the ACL, whatever.&nbsp; Usually it&rsquo;s not just one piece.&nbsp; For Square One, what will actually happen is that the banners extension, it is separated out just like any other extension.&nbsp; The only difference is that it&rsquo;s being maintained in conjunction with Joomla and just kept up to date so any changes they make inside of Joomla will be updated in that banners extension package and then when you hit check for updates in your copy of Square One it will notify you that the banners component has an update and you&rsquo;ll be able to update that instead of updating Square One you&rsquo;ll update just the banners extension.&nbsp; You see the difference where Joomla puts it all into one package since we&rsquo;ve split everything up in Square One your updates will actually come in different chunks based on where the updates actually apply.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s beautiful.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t lose anything but you gain a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Ultimately yes, very little loss, I have not found any issues yet with compatibility, it still uses the same framework and there&rsquo;s some template tweaks and changes but other than that, it&rsquo;s very much the same once you pull everything back in, you can have exactly what you had before in Joomla but that then defeats the purpose of using it, so that&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and you have a Google group for Square One CMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I started a mailing list and I haven&rsquo;t tried very hard to use it, there&rsquo;s not a lot of people yet who have, that people that I have talked with I have their direct emails so we&rsquo;ve been communicating&nbsp; that way or on GitHub through commit messages and things.&nbsp; So right now I think what it will be is a place for a lot of support and discussion considering most of what Square One is is still Joomla, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a lot of support for it, though most of the issues should actually be referred to Joomla as long as, unless they&rsquo;re Square One specific.&nbsp; So I don&rsquo;t know what that means as far as support and that kind of stuff yet, we will see as we go along I&rsquo;m kind of making up that on that basis of what&rsquo;s needed but the mailing list, there&rsquo;s a hope that it will be a great place for people to throw out ideas, discuss them and then ultimately a decision making tool so it&rsquo;s not just discussion but also a way for us to definitively nail down some of the details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well you put an idea in your Google Group about expanding your distro idea by having, let&rsquo;s say, horizontal distributions or a theme where one&rsquo;s a blogging distribution, one&rsquo;s an e-commerce, one&rsquo;s a whatever.&nbsp; You had about seven of them or so, and I thought &ldquo;are you biting off a little too much there?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Those are I think more in the focus for later on.&nbsp; Right now, that&rsquo;s not a huge part of what I&rsquo;m hoping to accomplish in the first version here.&nbsp; So, the first version, stable version of Square One will be released some time after 2.5 &ndash; approximately one month afterwards, just to give us time to make sure that all the changes have been integrated correctly and function and that none of the issues from Joomla 2.5 conflict with any changes that have been made in Square One, so the release cycle is going to be about a month after the official but it might be a little sooner if things are looking good.&nbsp; But long term &ndash; yes, putting together some official lists I think are important.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s going to be possible for a new user to come in and say I&rsquo;m going to build a website and I know that it&rsquo;s going to need to do these things.&nbsp; Well, they might not understand okay when they see a list of extensions that we are familiar with if we are a Joomla developer, oh banners okay I know what that is, I know what contacts does and yadda yadda yadda &ndash; a new person won&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So putting together some predefined options for somebody who wants to blog, that might pull in the content, it might pull in the latest news modules and some of the content plug-ins and search, you know it will pull in the pieces that we kind of as a group maybe or somebody has taken the effort to finalize a specification for what typically is necessary for a blogging website and that doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t do more and add more stuff later, it&rsquo;s sort of a quick start so they can load that up right away and see &ndash; oh okay &ndash; so I can see my content here and this there and a new person would be able to not have to worry about trying to figure out what all these other things are, just focusing in on the pieces that hopefully are relevant to their purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I sent you the email telling you I thought I don&rsquo;t know, if you put in one extension and not another one then someone might feel slighted or something, I thought just leave it to the extension developers to create their own distro based on yours.&nbsp; But I think you should go down the road and try it, because it&rsquo;s great leadership &ndash; you don&rsquo;t know &rsquo;till someone does it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not, there are lots of extensions, I will say there are too many extensions and if you whittle down exactly how many are compatible with 1.7, 2.5, you know are the latest versions of Joomla &ndash; that number will actually drop significantly if you&rsquo;re looking at the extensions directory, though I don&rsquo;t know exactly off the top of my head what it is.&nbsp; Not only that, you start whittling down how many of them are duplicates and essentially the same thing and you start looking at things like okay well which ones are actually being supported and which ones are people do they just write once and throw out there and make available and then you start looking at which ones have real support from behind them and which ones have lots of usage behind them.&nbsp; Your list will get narrowed fairly quickly to a hundred maybe extensions that I think are the majority of what people use and it&rsquo;s those little details that they will go and find those smaller extraneous extensions that maybe aren&rsquo;t well supported or there are you know, why are there five or I don&rsquo;t know many Twitter extensions there are, but there&rsquo;s got to be dozens of them, do they all do something different? Do they all bring something new to the table or are they all sort of rehashing similar things?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s an issue I think we as a community and part of my solution is to maybe think about consolidating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should we look at, especially with the smaller extensions that are doing maybe one or two things and they are all doing them slightly differently, is there a way that we can just do one or if we&rsquo;re talking about bigger extensions then we talk about, you know I think you mentioned in your email about e-commerce, that&rsquo;s tricky too.&nbsp; Those are much more difficult because they have large development processes and you pick one over the other and at this point I&rsquo;m not going to pick one or the other or anything but I&rsquo;m not afraid to do so if I can tell that one is going to be a better solution for the majority of people.&nbsp; So in the sense that putting together a distribution list saying okay this will set the e-commerce idea if this is going to be the officially supported, when I say officially supported, I mean the official list of extensions that are being considered part of the e-commerce pre-set then they&rsquo;re going to have to earn it and if somebody disagrees they&rsquo;re going to have to make their case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Make their own Distro!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;They can make their own distribution, they can make their case as to why they should be included or possibility that the two e-commerce, you know maybe there&rsquo;s two of them that are saying well we&rsquo;re both valid but we both such different things which is very possible when it&rsquo;s such a large system that it could warrant two different types of e-commerce and you just have to be able to clarify which niche they each fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>But they are also going to be capable of producing their own distributions</strong>&nbsp;and if they follow the rules which at the moment in Square One 2.5 they are going to be somewhat limited but in the next version there should be some additional features and functionalities that make it possible to expand the abilities so that&nbsp;<strong>commercial extensions can be supported more properly</strong>&nbsp;and various other little issues that arise when we have such a<strong>&nbsp;decentralized extension system</strong>, so there are some issues that need to be addressed there before people can really make a lot of the distributions that I think we have in mind or hope could eventually come into play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s actually a good lead-in to what I want to talk about briefly.&nbsp; Of all the videos whatever I&rsquo;ve seen at the different Joomla Days and all the conferences &ndash; you&rsquo;re the only person I&rsquo;ve seen who did a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/24421276\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Joomla and Beyond 2011 Continuous Integration presentation by Jeremy Wilken\">presentation on Continuous Integration</a>&nbsp;and I thought I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s exactly coincidental that the chap who did the Continuous Integration video presentation is now doing the first Joomla Distro; and, I thought is this really a coincidence or not?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know &ndash; is it? [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Continuous Integration is the deep recesses of software development, it talks about how to build it into the zip file that we all know, but there could be different steps along the way that get you to that zip file or there could be really no real process.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got, and I see this more and more in GitHub, there&rsquo;s a folder called &ldquo;build&rdquo; and that has the file that you use on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.phing.info/trac/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Phing website\">Phing</a>&nbsp;to create the zip &ndash; right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/24421276?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I looked two weeks ago so I hope I&rsquo;m not out of date and I&rsquo;m thinking if you&rsquo;re thinking of doing these other building on your distro to have more horizontal market distro, maybe you&rsquo;re thinking of how to use Continuous Integration to do it.&nbsp; [laughter] &hellip; pause &hellip; move onto another question?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Just rephrase the question please. [Good advice! -Bob]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have in the back of your mind doing Continuous Integration server techniques to build these other Distros with these other extensions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Not really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Because the maintenance can be a real pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">Well right, and part of the logic and the architecture behind what I&rsquo;m considering when I say a &ldquo;Distro&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s probably not the right term and I&rsquo;ve been toying with changing it, in fact I may be settled on a new one but I&rsquo;m still working on it, so &ldquo;Distro&rdquo;, when I say a distribution from here let me say that as a&nbsp;<u>whole packaged copy of the system with the changes and tweaks</u>.&nbsp; So like Square One is a full fledged distribution.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">What I&rsquo;m thinking about a lot when I say a &ldquo;Blogging Distro&rdquo; I&rsquo;m actually going to change that to like a&nbsp;<u>pre-set</u>&nbsp;really.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s a good term because what happens is is that actually&nbsp;<strong>a pre-set will be a list of the extensions that are available and it will go out and download them</strong>. So it&rsquo;s an .xml file that just has the list.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">That&rsquo;s all it takes to have your own custom pre-set or you know we can pretend that&rsquo;s like a distribution and instead of having to package and create your own full version of the software and distribute it yourself, you are capable of taking an .xml file, listing the extensions you consider a part of that distribution and then saying &ldquo;here, this is my distribution, install Square One and upload this file and it will set them all up for you&rdquo;</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So you&rsquo;re not going to do with those extensions what you do with Joomla?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Now like what you did with the banner component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not going to intermediate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a law of diminishing returns and in those extensions anything that&rsquo;s not currently part of Joomla has been written and maintained by somebody else, that&rsquo;s their copyright, that&rsquo;s their prerogative at the moment.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to take any of their information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The update system inside of Joomla which I have expanded in Square One</strong>&nbsp;makes it possible that as long as I know the link to a particular piece of information about that file so each of the extensions has to have an update manifest file essentially just a list of information about it.&nbsp; As long as I know that piece of information I can collect that into the list and use that to install every piece that I need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I&rsquo;m not actually going to package an extension or pull it into GitHub as an official of Square One</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now there may be some exceptions, for example if looking at one of the plug-ins there is a contact plug-in called, I think it&rsquo;s GeSHi (I&rsquo;ve never had to say it out loud), it&rsquo;s code syntax highlighter, it&rsquo;s quite old and there are many others out there that probably are better.&nbsp; I would not be opposed in that case to actually switch them, you know for updating one of these older plug-ins or something you know, maybe if we can replace a few or include other pieces that are highly critical; but, at this point I&rsquo;m not to that point as far as pulling in and changing things, I&rsquo;m just currently working on keeping it as compatible and stable with Joomla and keeping the current list of extensions available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I put you on the spot a bit, I think, because you were just floating an idea and I think I made it sound like it was something that was in the works, this is just something you were thinking about and I was curious if your experience with Continuous Integration was part of that thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Well,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\"><strong>learning about Continuous Integration setting it up and working with it as well as just the build process and things makes you aware of certain things that this would not be possible if I didn&rsquo;t have some of these tools available, like Git, if I didn&rsquo;t have Phing for building, if I didn&rsquo;t use Jenkins for integration.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes it possible for me to manage the code more and spend less time on managing the flow of information and stuff.&nbsp; So, all I have to do is focus on the code and&nbsp;<strong>hit a button that says build and it will grab the latest changes, it will make a change lot, it will zip it up, it will send it to my drop box and I have a copy within a few minutes of Square One as I just committed and doing that manually every time I needed to do it would just kill my ability to actually work on it</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So,&nbsp;<strong>yes it does inspire you to do some things because you have a knowledge of tools</strong>&nbsp;that make it possible to spend time on the things that are most important and not repetitive which is writing code and making improvements and letting those repetitive tasks be handled by a computer which happens to do them quite well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well what you just said was the kind of thing that over the holidays<a href=\"http://www.southlasallecommerce.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=67:introducing-continuous-integration\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Introducing Continuous Integration\">&nbsp;inspired me to look at Jenkins, to read the PDF</a>&nbsp;and I see that GitHub has the Open Source Janky and I thought what you&rsquo;re doing somehow somewhere Continuous Integration must be helping out somewhere, because the only person who ever did a presentation on it and is doing the Distro, this must be somewhere there and I think you&rsquo;re onto something, I really do and it will be great to see more people express their vision of how they think these Open Source packages should be implemented by doing what you&rsquo;re doing, by intermediating it and getting extra value added too.&nbsp; So, I think it&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;The Joomla platform has also quite a bit of integration [at the January Toronto Joomla meet-up, I talked to a member of the team about Jenkins -Bob] and I don&rsquo;t have all the details but they have a lot of their files available, so they&rsquo;re doing a good job &ndash; they have build tests [actually, &ldquo;build&rdquo; and &ldquo;tests&rdquo; are separate CI processes -Bob] running, they have code sniffers which are basically checking for code syntax and so that things are formatted well and various other checks in place so that their automation is far above what I have set up for Square One right now, but the possibilities are quite endless and it takes some time and understanding to get it all set up and working but yes, I hope to also be able to provide information about how some things are being done with Square One but&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\"><strong>the POWER of it can never be understated as long as there is a possibility there&rsquo;s a way to probably do it somehow through automation or automatic testing or whatever the process you need</strong></span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and with that our 25 minutes is gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;So quick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and we did two parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;I know, well I think we did a pretty good job of getting through what Square One is and what I hope it can become here in the next months and years, hopefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I look forward to having you on the show in about three months and thank you so much for being here today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for inviting me and hopefully there will be a lot of new things to talk about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

Today is Thursday, February 23th, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Langford joins me today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Alan, how are you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m good thank you Bob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Alan, thank you for being such a good sport about our December interview. Our Skype recording did not save to disk after multiple takes, which led to my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2011/tbbs42\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Virtual Guest Alan Langford on Joomla Distro, Content Pattern Plugin, and Transcripts\">first interview with a Virtual Guest</a>.&nbsp; Which is an interesting idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Well I sure sounded good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;We talked at last week&rsquo;s Toronto Joomla Meetup of which you are our Grand Poobah.&nbsp; We talked about your new commercial extension.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is your new commercial extension?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Super Table Pro, currently awaiting approval by the Joomla Extensions Directory &ndash; you want to know about it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well should we, we talked about the JED, I&rsquo;m thinking we should talk about that &ndash; yes tell us about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got a couple of forum posts.&nbsp; I really have a lot of sympathy for the guys in the extensions directory.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to be particularly critical of them &ndash; they have a huge job and they&rsquo;re doing stuff on a volunteer basis just like everybody else on the project; and, you know, when you have an extension sitting in the queue you want it to be approved yesterday, but last time I checked there was 161 between me and there, so they really do have a massive job to do and I think to be critical of them is not necessarily fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s 161 extensions in the queue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;At this point in time, as of yesterday morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And they&rsquo;re up to 8,800?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;You know it was over 9,000 for a while there and then I think they must have done a house cleaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it certainly is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And Super Tables Pro &ndash; what is that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Okay well I&rsquo;ll back up a bit.&nbsp; The Super Table is a quick little plug in that allows you to turn a standard html table into a really nice looking table in a matter of seconds, in about 30 seconds and you can drop in some predefined styles and you&rsquo;ve got a table that&rsquo;s got a little animation in it and you know it was originally developed for display of hosting plans on Abivia.net of course; and, it was so much fun that I decided to turn it into a plugin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same thing, mostly an internal requirement our hosting plans come out of a pricing database and from time to time those prices change and I&rsquo;m not a really good one for remembering all the places where you have to go in and manually change things in order to get the price on this side to look the price on that side.&nbsp; Since all this stuff is in a database the logical solution is to just have a query populate the table and away we go.&nbsp; And so that&rsquo;s what Super Table Pro does &ndash; it allows you to query a local or remote Joomla database, or anything that Joomla supports for a database connection, so you know my SQL and you know in 2.5 SQL Server to fire a query over it to get a row set back and then to do a little bit of formatting and turn it into a snazzy looking table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;What would possess you to commercialize an extension you&rsquo;ve built for your own site?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Well, obviously, I guess there&rsquo;s a couple of things.&nbsp; One, you know you want to re-coup your investment, you want to share what you&rsquo;ve done with the community, but this is a pretty specific requirement.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t have somebody who is doing something that&rsquo;s close to development for pulling up a SQL query and a couple of other things then you don&rsquo;t really have a use for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The free version I think covers 95% of the needs out there and getting the database connectivity in was a significant amount of effort and I felt that I wanted to share it but at the same time that it was going to be other developers that were using it and those developers were probably making money in the process so they should not have a big problem with sending me a little bit of money along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But this is your first ever commercial extension &ndash; right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;It is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So what put you over.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve always had extensions you&rsquo;ve offered for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>Right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Which are the same &ndash; you&rsquo;ve used them yourself and you just offer them for free download?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Right &ndash; exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But this time was different&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Well you know, for the most part the free extensions that I&rsquo;ve got are not what I would call huge development efforts.&nbsp; You know, some of them might have sort of turned into it after the fact but for the most part they were just things that were interesting like let&rsquo;s get a Twitter Feed up, you know, let&rsquo;s make it so that when another extension insists on putting a signature in that you can make the signature go away.&nbsp; I mean there was some complexity in there but in terms of actual monetary value to someone building a site, you know, a lot of those things I just don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s prepared to pay for.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s necessarily a market for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing that has the potential for going commercial would be the Abivia Content Patterns plugin and that, I think, in order to be a commercial product actually needs a component that really supports the data structures and makes it easier to use.&nbsp; I mean it&rsquo;s very much a developer tool as it stands.&nbsp; It could be an end user tool if it had a great UI but that great UI would require significant investment in software development and you know at that point in time I would probably make the great UI a commercial product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So what&rsquo;s the demarcation between commercial and free?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Well, one, I think is &ndash; will anybody pay for it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I&rsquo;ve got, well take Auto-copyright for example.&nbsp; You know this nice little plugin that you put in the date you started your site so 2009 and then you tell it where you want it to put the current year in and in 2011 it says 2009-2011 and in 2012 it changes to 2012.&nbsp; I mean it&rsquo;s possibly the simplest extension we&rsquo;ve ever written and I was incredibly surprised that it hadn&rsquo;t actually been done right before &ndash; there were two or three attempts at it, but nobody actually implemented the requirements that your average site has.&nbsp; And so you know, I literally took two and a half hours to put it together and then fired it up into the extensions directory and it&rsquo;s proven to be extremely popular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I wouldn&rsquo;t pay for that, you know I mean there&rsquo;s two hours of development involved, it&rsquo;s a convenience, so that&rsquo;s never going to be a commercial extension.&nbsp; Whereas I think the same thing is true of the Super Table.&nbsp; The non pro version is neat and it does some interesting things but would somebody shell out 20 bucks just to get a sexy looking table?&nbsp; You know, would I shell out 20 bucks just to get a sexy looking table is probably the question.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t think that I would.&nbsp; Whereas would I shell out a little bit of money in order to get something that knows how to connect into a database, knows how to do prefixes if I&rsquo;m connecting to a different Joomla database with a different prefix that I can set that up and I can do all these things that I can stash my database credentials away in the plugin parameters so there&rsquo;s a little bit of security and then I never have to go back and change this web page again when the core data changes someplace else.&nbsp; Okay, now that&rsquo;s valuable, so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s commercial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s interesting of course&hellip; with Moneyball on my mind all the time these days and where the value is.&nbsp; Why would somebody consider that so valuable they pay for it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Well,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Because it&rsquo;s hard to replicate that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah I mean the code is non-trivial, you know, there&rsquo;s a significant amount of work involved in getting it to do it right and to build it and make it reliably.&nbsp; I mean, I probably spent, sum total a couple of weeks on it, so there&rsquo;s probably a couple of thousand dollars worth of development time into the plugin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So there&rsquo;s a significant barrier of technical skill and time it takes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly, it&rsquo;s not something that you would go back out and you know just go oh well, it&rsquo;s not like autocopy.&nbsp; Autocopy, if somebody wants ten bucks for it it&rsquo;s like, eh, I can do that myself in, I can in something and pull in some source code and I can hack it together in you know a couple of minutes.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s not even worth five bucks to me.&nbsp; Because then what if it doesn&rsquo;t work, what if it&rsquo;s this, what if it&rsquo;s that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You know there&rsquo;s always an acquisition cost for an extension</em>.&nbsp; You know you go and you find something in the extensions directory and it looks wonderful and it&rsquo;s got reviews and it&rsquo;s got all this kind of stuff but how frequently is it that you install it and it either doesn&rsquo;t do something the way you want or it&rsquo;s got some kind of fundamental breakage or just what you understand that it did isn&rsquo;t what it actually does.&nbsp; But it takes time to go through that process of evaluating and looking at it, and, if you&rsquo;re like me, I actually crank open the code and take a look at the quality of the code underneath because if I install it on a customer site and the developer gets hit by a truck, I&rsquo;m the guy who has to be able to make sure that something gets fixed if it&rsquo;s busted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Joe at the Toronto Meet Up, Joe and I talked about that &ndash; big time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to get into that right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;No, I mean it&rsquo;s a whole other thing, but it is one of the things that plays into the Open Source equation you know, and if you&rsquo;re just an end user and you&rsquo;re downloading extensions and it works or doesn&rsquo;t work and you know, that&rsquo;s one thing, but you know I have clients who pay me money to build websites that work and so I have a certain amount of responsibility. If I&rsquo;ve come along and I&rsquo;ve said &ldquo;okay, here&rsquo;s XYZ extension and it&rsquo;s going to do this job for you Mr. Customer&rdquo;, if it doesn&rsquo;t do that job Mr. Customer really doesn&rsquo;t care whether or not it was written by Joe, Sam, Bob or anybody else &ndash; he&rsquo;s holding me responsible for it working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I have to make sure that there&rsquo;s a certain quality bar in anything that I install, even anything as simple as Autocopy &ndash; you want to go in and make sure it&rsquo;s not doing things like, you know the original reason why I wrote my Social Bookmarking Plugin is because they most popular version that was on the extensions directory had a very clever hidden back link to a foreign exchange trading site.&nbsp; So it was just generating link juice for Google in a way that you know Google would see the page if it wasn&rsquo;t running Java Script but that it disappeared completely and the &ldquo;add this&rdquo; widget came up instead.&nbsp; Well I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not going to be doing that to any of my customers and if I hadn&rsquo;t looked at the source code I wouldn&rsquo;t have discovered that, so I promptly recoded the functionality from scratch [naturally &ndash; Bob] and introduced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well I mean I didn&rsquo;t even use this code because it was pretty crappy, but you know, and the add this API is fully documented so it&rsquo;s not that difficult to go in and do a replacement and set up some parameters for it, but then I went and posted it back into the extensions directory saying &ldquo;hey this one doesn&rsquo;t have back links&rdquo;.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not playing ball as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I did a homemade plugin for site subscriptions just to make sure that you couldn&rsquo;t really get into a certain component.&nbsp; The plugin says, if option=com_xx, then redirect, but I would never consider putting that even up for free download because I don&rsquo;t want to support it.&nbsp; It sort of the basis the way Bob does it, but when you put it up for paid you have extra responsibility to support it now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I believe you do, but you know I think if you make something available you have a certain responsibility to support it anyway, you know I mean I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of the fire and forget mode, where you know somebody writes some little ditty and then takes it and sticks it up on Joomla code and gets a JED listing for it and then completely walks away from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will be introducing a PayPal donations component at some point in time because all of them are based on old versions of the PayPal API, none of them has been updated, the commercial ones and the non-commercial ones are all based on the same bad code as far as I could tell and I haven&rsquo;t actually gone back and looked at it closely for a year or so ago but it was just so awful that I&rsquo;m going to re-code it simply because I don&rsquo;t want it breaking and then I&rsquo;ll make it available to everybody else just because what&rsquo;s the point of keeping it under wraps.&nbsp; The only time I build something that I don&rsquo;t release is when I&rsquo;m not willing to put in the extra effort to product-ize it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;[laughing] Productize it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.&nbsp; My multi-twitter widget is still, unfortunately, firmly based in 1.5, I have some significant work to do in order to get it up to the 2.5 standard so I&rsquo;ve implemented a couple of 2.5 sites that needed a Twitter presence so I&rsquo;ve implemented the Twitter Widget into a module that allows me to put Twitter&rsquo;s generic widget up there, I haven&rsquo;t got that up as a free download on Abivia.net at this point largely because there&rsquo;s a certain amount of effort required to go in and describe it and to just get it to the point where people know what the plugin parameters are and just a little bit of basic documentation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just not going to release crap, so it&rsquo;s got to have a certain standard before I&rsquo;ll put it up on the site and getting multi-twitter ported to 2.5 is actually more important than getting that widget up, so it will sit there in my private tool kit but there aren&rsquo;t very many things that are in my private tool kit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Super Table Pro is compact enough it sounds like it doesn&rsquo;t need a lot of support anyways, not like the other extensions we&rsquo;ve talked about on my podcasts.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t really expect that you&rsquo;re going to need a lot of support and if somebody sees a sort of a weakness you could put documentation right into that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp; I guess you&rsquo;d just be getting bug reports more than support requests?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, exactly and I think that making it a commercial extension also helps with that.&nbsp; I think if it was available as a free download then I&rsquo;d probably have a flood of support requests with people asking me how to write SQL queries [bet your ass -Bob].&nbsp; That&rsquo;s pretty much out of scope for support, at least I think if you&rsquo;ve got somebody who&rsquo;s willing to put a little bit of money in order to get the component that they&rsquo;re serious about what they&rsquo;re doing and it&rsquo;s not that they misunderstand, because there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who have a very limited understanding of technology and they&rsquo;ll think, well, you know I&rsquo;ve read the description of your component and I just thought all of my data was magically going to appear on my page, now you have to help me.&nbsp; I feel for those people, they&rsquo;re coming from a position of ignorance but the learning curve is really really high and there&rsquo;s no way that I can support a bunch of people through that learning curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a problem that an extension is a Trojan Horse for consulting; and, support, whether it&rsquo;s free or commercial, has come up again and again and again.&nbsp; People need consulting and they try to get it for free or low cost by getting an extension and then blaming &ldquo;oh it doesn&rsquo;t work, or you know your think doesn&rsquo;t like this&rdquo;.&nbsp; Like you said the queries, so, but, your extension is compact, there&rsquo;s not a lot of room for misunderstanding what it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Right, exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;How did you determine what the price would be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;It was pretty much a seat of the pants guess.&nbsp; Basically it&rsquo;s 35 bucks.&nbsp; So, $25 just seemed like it was a little too low for some reason and 50 bucks seemed too high.&nbsp; So I kind of tried to pick a number that was somewhere in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that, you know, I don&rsquo;t have expectations that I&rsquo;m going to sell thousands of these things.&nbsp; If I thought it was going to be the world&rsquo;s most popular extension I might move the price point down a little bit, I&rsquo;m actually debating version 1.1 will come out fairly soon and it will allow you to do highlighting across rows instead of just highlighting down columns and this has come from people who have seen the Super Table Pro, they want to query databases and it&rsquo;s clear the application is things like parts lists, where you&rsquo;ve got long tables of multiple values so you might have four columns but 30 or 40 rows.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s clearly a row mode version that&rsquo;s going to be in 1.1 it&rsquo;s going to be part of the Pro package but that&rsquo;s something that I think has some common utility to people who are just doing html tables now, highlighting the other way around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m debating whether or not I should stick it in the Pro version and move the price point down, if I should leave it status quo or if I should just stick it into the free version and you know, there&rsquo;s no definitive manual that tells you what the right choice is &ndash; you just sort of have to guess and see how it works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;If the price is too low, people who buy it really don&rsquo;t value it.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s priced a little higher the people have to, they feel that it&rsquo;s valuable.&nbsp; I think that this is substitution here, that it&rsquo;s cheaper to get it from you than to write it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;or to get something and hack it.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s a substitute for hiring a mercenary to do this, or a developer would rather do work they can bill than &hellip;.. you know what I mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So I think if you price it high enough it&rsquo;s like well, that&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m making this up &ndash; a half hour of what&rsquo;s a half hour of billable time &ndash; right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like they, so in a way they think well there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of us and in a sense we&rsquo;re just amortizing the cost across all the purchasers is something technical that we need; and, I think that&rsquo;s a good fit for you, because I gave you trouble about your price at the Toronto Joomla Meet Up. [laughter] I&rsquo;m understanding it more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, plus it&rsquo;s also something where you know if you&rsquo;re a PHP developer you might sit there and go yeah well no problem, I&rsquo;ll just imbed a little bit of PHP, I&rsquo;ll pull this stuff up, I can do this and I can format a table and off I go &ndash; which is true. But, at the same time you&rsquo;d also better be pretty good at Java Script and css &rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s some tricky stuff that goes on over there, especially in the css.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe you can get your data out of the database and get it onto a page but making it look good once it&rsquo;s on that page is perhaps a little bit more difficult.&nbsp; On the other hand you might be a css whiz and you can get that table to, you know you can crank that out in half a day but chances are you don&rsquo;t understand SQL queries at the same time so you know there&rsquo;s a broad skill set that goes into it and there&rsquo;s complexity on either side and it&rsquo;s sort of like I just want to make it compelling, I want somebody to look at it and go boy I could spend two days working on this and get something that might work and might need support or I can drop 35 bucks on this and know that it&rsquo;s coming from an extension developer with a really good reputation for support, especially on the free side, and good ratings on the extension directory and all those other things.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m clearly not about to go away, I&rsquo;m not going to abandon the thing tomorrow morning and disappear, so it&rsquo;s probably a pretty safe investment of not a huge amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So the idea is to make it a compelling purchase</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I always find it hard because you can get a three month template subscription from one of the clubs for $35 and get all the extensions that come with the templates and stuff and then there&rsquo;s this niche, like you have, and it&rsquo;s $35 and it&rsquo;s like &ldquo;oh wow in comparison this is massive&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So, there&rsquo;s thousands of people on this template club and it&rsquo;s a niche product, so people just don&rsquo;t make the jump.&nbsp; They think everything should be $35, $25, $10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Right, but those aren&rsquo;t the people that I&rsquo;m selling this product to.&nbsp; This, like ACP or something like that, these are things that are designed for people who are building websites, not necessarily for people who are just going out and downloading Joomla and buying a template from somebody and then starting to tinker around.&nbsp; First off the chances that they are going to need the Pro features of Super Table are pretty low, if that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing, and they&rsquo;re not my target market.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m interested in people who are looking to find ways to build sites that are professional, dynamic and that they&rsquo;re not going to get a call from a customer saying &ldquo;hey you know we changed our pricing database, can you go back to that article that&rsquo;s got out stuff on it and update all the prices for me?&rdquo;.&nbsp; I mean, I don&rsquo;t know about you but for me that&rsquo;s the worst kind of work to have to do, is a customer calls you and says can you just go in and modify a little bit of text for me and here&rsquo;s a new pricing sheet and here&rsquo;s the excel sheet, go and copy/paste all these values in the right place and don&rsquo;t make a mistake.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my version of hell.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willing to pay 35 bucks to get out of that one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Then you build that little database table, a client doesn&rsquo;t know and you put all the numbers in there and connect it to your extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, or if it&rsquo;s actually coming out of a data source someplace, if&nbsp; it&rsquo;s coming out of your network attached SQL server that&rsquo;s got your major pricing database on it then all you have to do is write a query that works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;As long as you can connect to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Right exactly, but if it&rsquo;s a back end network and you know one of the things that will come out in Super Table 1.2 will be the ability to grab probably XML and JSON from through a GET request, so then you&rsquo;ll be able to do web services update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Wow.&nbsp; You should put this in the commercial part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Oh that&rsquo;s definitely going to be in the commercial part.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s coded for the original spec for this was static tables then database queries and then web services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s amazing once you have an extension how it expands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;You know, this has been an incredibly surprising extension.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been out now for I guess 65 days.&nbsp; It became popular on the extensions directory almost immediately, it&rsquo;s been viewed there over 10,000 times, I&rsquo;ve had close to 3,000 downloads, it&rsquo;s just been an exceptionally surprisingly popular plugin and so I was busy working away on the Pro version just after I released the initial version because that was my personal requirements to get my own database queries running on this thing and the thing basically lit up so it&rsquo;s been getting a fair bit more attention as a result of that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sold a couple of copies, it&rsquo;s not even listed on the extensions directory yet so I have high hopes that when it does make it through that hurdle that we&rsquo;ll see some significant traffic on it and we&rsquo;ll go from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sales to date are all down to Brian Teeman who initially discovered Super Table the non Pro version and used it on the<a href=\"http://jandbeyond.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Joomla and Beyond Conference\">JandBeyond site</a>&nbsp;for 2012 and then when I got the database queries going I told him about it and he picked it up and used it to database drive some of the stuff out of the site now and then he mentioned it in his newsletter and said wonderful things about it so I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of PR from some very influential people and it&rsquo;s very much appreciated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and deserved</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;well thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re a little over, but it&rsquo;s always a pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s been fun as usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think everyone has to come to the Toronto Meet Ups to talk to Alan.&nbsp; Time flies.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s our show and this is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(52, 88, 3, 'Tbbs48', '<p>Welcome to my 48th &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, March 08th, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I have the pleasure of talking to Nicholas Dionysopoulos. Nicholas, great to have&nbsp; you here. How are you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Great to be here, I&rsquo;m fine Bob &ndash; how are you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m all right.&nbsp; My Snowball microphone is not being recognized so I&rsquo;m using a headset, so I hope to get that fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your website is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.akeebabackup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Akeeba Backup site\">AkeebaBackup.com</a>.&nbsp; You have quite a portfolio of software, you&rsquo;ve got:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:square\">\r\n	<li>Admin Tools</li>\r\n	<li>Akeeba Backup</li>\r\n	<li>Akeeba Release System</li>\r\n	<li>Akeeba Subscriptions</li>\r\n	<li>Akeeba Kickstart</li>\r\n	<li>Akeeba eXtract Wizard</li>\r\n	<li>Remote CLI &ndash; a command line</li>\r\n	<li>Akeeba SiteDiff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Akeeba Backup is your flagship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And it is one of the most downloaded extensions in the Joomla Extension Directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah that&rsquo;s correct, I think that right now we&rsquo;re at about I think we&rsquo;re over 3 million downloads in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Wow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it also includes some downloads from Admin Tools so I guess that the real figure is right there about 3 million downloads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Wow! And on your site you&rsquo;re using&nbsp; a homemade forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not actually a forum, it&rsquo;s a mix of a forum and a ticket system.&nbsp; The difference to a forum is that you can&rsquo;t reply to somebody else&rsquo;s ticket anymore.&nbsp; This is because I had a very big problem with people hijacking other peoples threads with a completely different issue and this made support impossible but I also didn&rsquo;t want to have all the tickets private because most of the questions are frequently asked or they represent a bug that is just discovered so I don&rsquo;t want to type in the same reply all the time and I had to make this somewhat searchable and this is why I went with this kind of hybrid system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That you made yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;In your spare time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Well not exactly spare, but yeah. I had to sacrifice some development time from other products in order to create this ticket system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Because by the time you tweak an existing extension you might as well whip up your own thing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it did actually take me much longer to configure an existing extension the way I wanted it.&nbsp; There was extension which would allow me to have public tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This is the same way that Akeeba Subscriptions came into being. You had a need so you made your own?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, actually this is how all Open Source Software comes to existence.&nbsp; There is a developer who is scratching his own needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Who is scratching his own needs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Itch! [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I read &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have the link &ndash; but somebody asked if you&rsquo;re going to release the forum or your ticket system to the public and you were thinking about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I&rsquo;m still thinking about it. The thing is that it&rsquo;s not something that I can release as it is right now.&nbsp; I mean, it lacks all the polish.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very very rough.&nbsp; There are a lot of features missing in order to be something that you can use generically on many different sides.&nbsp; Certainly it does require a lot of development time to bring it to a state where I can say that I can release this thing and of course I have to document it, because right now there is absolutely no documentation for something which is only used internally.&nbsp; The thing is that I don&rsquo;t have the time right now, I don&rsquo;t know if I will have that time in the near future a<em>nd there is another thing that the more software I build the more support requests are coming in which means that I have even less&nbsp; time to develop my software, so it&rsquo;s a very tough call, a really tough call</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and at this point you would also have to release it commercially, not for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Well yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s a ticket system, obviously it&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re using if you are making money.&nbsp; I think that the only extension which you can use only for commercial websites that I have released for free is Akeeba Subscriptions, but that is a very big story about why that happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an interesting case study.&nbsp; Just as a side note I realized using it you don&rsquo;t have recurring subscriptions and I thought well &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t use it for his site&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;I think that you have to wait 2 more days and there will be recurring subscriptions.&nbsp; I have finished that feature yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Wow!&nbsp; [Indeed, now released a week or so after this interview -Bob]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it only works with PayPal right now, and the thing with recurring subscriptions is that people think that &ldquo;hey I could have money in my pocket every so often no strings attached is very cool&rdquo;.&nbsp; Well it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated.&nbsp; For example PayPal doesn&rsquo;t allow you to define arbitrary periods for the recurring payments, it has to 0-90 days or 1-52 weeks or 1-24 months or 1-5 years and all of these mean different things to PayPal so you have to do an approximation and this can lead to some very interesting problems like a subscription may expire and become automatically renewed two days later.&nbsp; It requires a lot of tweaking to get it right and of course if someone wants to unsubscribe from your recurring subscription they have to do that through PayPal, they can&rsquo;t do that through your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas</strong>: So if people think that recurring subscriptions solve a problem, for every problem they solve they create another five. [laughter] But people want that so if they ask me what is the best way to jump off a cliff &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to tell them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I assume you don&rsquo;t use it for your site and this wouldn&rsquo;t be a feature? I&rsquo;m surprised you made it a feature.&nbsp; Is this from what people were asking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s actually the most frequently requested feature for Akeeba Subscriptions and at some point I became so tired of telling people why recurring subscriptions cause more problems than what they solve so I said &ldquo;okay, well you want it&rdquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like ACL in Joomla 1.6 and later &ndash; people were begging for ACL and when they saw what ACL is, what a beast it is, how difficult it is to configure, they said &ldquo;why did he implement ACL?&rdquo; because you asked for it.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s the same thing here, you get what you&rsquo;re asking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Wow, interesting.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about your framework for your extensions, because it helps you creating and maintaining all of your extensions &ndash; although I don&rsquo;t think you have it in Akeeba Backup. [FoF Session scheduled for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jandbeyond.org/programme/sessions/124-Rapid%20application%20development%20with%20FOF.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FoF Session JAB2012\">Joomla! and Beyond 2012 conference</a>&nbsp;-Bob]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s currently used only in Akeeba Subscriptions and Admin Tools and another two internal projects &ndash; Akeeba Ticket System which is the support system that I am using on my site and Doc Import which is the documentation system that I&rsquo;m using on my site.&nbsp; Akeeba Backup and Akeeba Release System are not using the FOF (that&rsquo;s the name of the framework) yet.&nbsp; Akeeba Release System is going to be rewritten at some point in order to make use of FOF but I am not sure that I am going to do the same thing for Akeeba Backup because Akeeba Backup is a completely different thing &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with database management which is the point of having a framework like FOF.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s basically the front end to a back up engine with options stored in a very strange way almost like flat files inside the database for performance reasons.&nbsp; So I don&rsquo;t think that Akeeba Backup will benefit at all from being implemented on this framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And you weren&rsquo;t thinking of&nbsp; releasing this little framework on its own but now you&rsquo;re thinking maybe you might?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Well ideally it should be documented before release but I mean, well if you&rsquo;re going to use something like that, you&rsquo;re a developer.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a developer the code is your documentation &ndash; after all there is&nbsp; my free extensions to show you how to use it.&nbsp; I already know three people who are using it for their own projects even though it&rsquo;s not officially released and the other thing which kept me from releasing it is that up to one month ago you had to install the frameworks files inside your own extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;This was on purpose because it wasn&rsquo;t really ready for release yet but right now everything is installed inside Joomla&rsquo;s libaries directory and I have created all the necessary code which allows the installer to detect if a newer version of the framework is already installed so as not to overwrite it.&nbsp; So the only thing which is missing right now is a system plug-in which should load the base classes, the autoloader class of the framework.&nbsp; Once I create this tiny plug-in it will be ready for release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And when you update the framework you have to update your extensions to work on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;No? Once it&rsquo;s all in the library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, backwards compatibility is of paramount importance on this framework.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;m trying to achieve is to have a very stable framework which will require changes to your extension only if Joomla is completely rewritten from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;um hum [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;I think that this will never happen, but there is a possibility that this might actually happen sooner than we think.&nbsp; I mean, the next task which is on the Joomla Platform in 10 years to do list is to rewrite the MVC framework.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure what they are going to do when they say that they are going to rewrite the MVC framework.&nbsp; Most likely they are going to implement extra features on the existing MVC framework pretty much what I am doing with FOF so in this case a complete rewrite of your extensions is not going to be necessary.&nbsp; However they might try to do something completely different in which case all extensions for Joomla would have to be rewritten from scratch.&nbsp; But frankly I have no idea whatsoever what are we going to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, um you are so prolific and&nbsp; your documentation is so detailed (as I change the subject) and you have so much support to do &mdash; I can&rsquo;t even imagine 3 million downloads, how much support you really do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;I just checked this &ndash; it&rsquo;s 4,105,349 right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t even imagine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know if you do everything yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Well I do most things by myself.&nbsp; Right now I have one guy who is doing part-time support, so far he is not very very active in the ticket system yet because in order to do support for the kind of products that I am managing, you need experience and training so most likely over the next few weeks he is going to be much more active and I have started working together with another developer so that I can offload some of my work especially some work for Akeeba Subscriptions and the other, let&rsquo;s say, the not flagship software, but everything that I have done up to this point was mostly done by Yours Truly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes and great job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/nikosdion/status/176245194805608448\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Forget Selenium (tweet)\">tweeted last Sunday</a>&nbsp;something a topic that I don&rsquo;t recall you tweeting about or talking about and it&rsquo;s about<a href=\"http://seleniumhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Selenium web application testing system\">Selenium</a>&nbsp;the GUI tester for browsers and you said &ldquo;say hello to<a href=\"http://sikuli.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Project Sikuli\">Sikuli</a>&ldquo;.&nbsp; and I thought do you use Selenium or Sikuli in your testing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Not right now I&rsquo;m not using Selenium.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried to use Selenium but it gets very complicated very fast especially if you have a lot of changes in the user interface like I have.&nbsp; You practically have to rewrite your tests and rewriting your tests is not very easy.&nbsp; But Sikuli, it&rsquo;s actually a very good idea because it&rsquo;s based on images.&nbsp; It tries to match the image that you gave it and this means that I can just take screen shots in order to update my tests and this is something I&rsquo;m very interested in because let&rsquo;s say that right now for Akeeba Backup I have 17 different test profiles and I have to run one after the other to make sure that nothing breaks.&nbsp; Right now I have to do that manually before releasing a new version and this is not very fun, obviously this is not something that a human should do &ndash; obviously.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s something that a computer should do automatically and just notify me when something breaks and I think that Sikuli is actually going to help me towards that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>I&rsquo;m going to write some automated tests for Akeeba Backup</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So Sikuli is not just to automate the browser testing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;It cannot automate all graphical user interface testing even if you have an application on your computer or even you have a mobile application running in an emulator or over a VPN.&nbsp; It can automate everything which has to do with graphical user interface testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and it lets you test one thing and when it passes then it will test the next thing and when that passes, it will test the next thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Well so far I haven&rsquo;t seen how it&rsquo;s possible to chain all the tests but I believe that this is going to be possible, I mean it&rsquo;s a testing tool it&rsquo;s supposed to do that.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t tested the testing tools ability to perform the testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You haven&rsquo;t tested the testing, I totally understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;So, it&rsquo;s something that it should be able to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But you&rsquo;re going through a manual process right now and you&rsquo;re hitting a wall with that.&nbsp; Because also you&rsquo;ve got all these different extension so it&rsquo;s like a matrix of manual testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine writing unit tests for my software mostly because especially when you&rsquo;re looking at Akeeba Backup&rsquo;s engine it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to have unit tests because all the bugs that I have fixed so far had to do with fringe conditions, it had to do with how much memory is being consumed, how much time it takes to run something &ndash; all the dynamic interaction.&nbsp; Very frequently I have put something through the debugger, it worked perfectly and when I tried to run it live on the same server it crashes.&nbsp; So much for automated testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I think it&rsquo;s such a special program and like you say it&rsquo;s not database intensive it works with you know, it&rsquo;s backing up.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s creating archives, it&rsquo;s uploading to the remote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s written in an interpretive language, because that&rsquo;s what PHP is.&nbsp; This is not the ideal environment to write a back-up software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You have to deal with so many things a lot of extension developers don&rsquo;t have to get in to &ndash; about how the different web hosts work and the ins and outs of what ports are open or whatever all that is &ndash; it&rsquo;s just &hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it gets very complicated very fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;ve done it for years and years and years, so, but your knowledge of all the different hosts and the different systems.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people have to get so intimate with the underlying server for their extensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;No, very few people have to actually go through that very deep level of understanding of how the web host is going to function or malfunction.&nbsp; I mean, if you take a look at the Joomla update process right now &ndash; it should work on all hosts but it doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; For example if you are on a particular web host I believe that I cannot call it by name here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;but everybody understands the process okay, if you are on that particular host the update works only once every five times. That&rsquo;s because they have a lot of restrictions upon restrictions and a very crappy server.&nbsp; They have a very slow server, you have to use the FTP layer.&nbsp; They have a two minute time-out limit set in Apache.&nbsp; They have CPU users limits if there are a lot of requests on the server which is very likely everything is going to take even longer so it&rsquo;s more probable that you are going to hit one of those limits and the end result is that the process doesn&rsquo;t work and people were wondering why that happens.&nbsp; I mean, yeah, there are probably only a few hundred people in the world who had to deal with that with this kind of intimacy with a server to understand why this happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes I&rsquo;m surprised you just don&rsquo;t say on your site, you know, Akeeba Backup just doesn&rsquo;t work on this host.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s proven it doesn&rsquo;t work and we won&rsquo;t support it &ndash; use it at your own risk. Or have a forum when you sign up for the Pro Version &ndash; what web host do you use?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;It always depends on the site you have and the host you have.&nbsp; I mean, even on this particular host it&rsquo;s possible to use Akeeba Backup but if you have a very big site or very big files then it&rsquo;s possible that it won&rsquo;t work &ndash; no matter what you try to do because at some point you&rsquo;re going to hit all the limitations of your server environment and you can&rsquo;t do anything about that except buy an upgrade.&nbsp; I mean, I can&rsquo;t say that it doesn&rsquo;t work on this and that host because this is simply not true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It depends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it always depends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I just installed Square One Distro over my WordPress site &ndash; right in the webroot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, that&rsquo;s a very good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So that, yeah it&rsquo;s a great idea, so that I could use your Akeeba Pro to back up my WordPress site, my Media site and not worrying about using the front end of Joomla &ndash; it worked.&nbsp; Of course I had to get rid of the Joomla index.php in the root but it worked and I&rsquo;ve got it uploading.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not going to have it upload my MP3&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m just sure &ndash; they&rsquo;re static files and they&rsquo;re just, I&rsquo;m going to hit a time out with those, I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;and there&rsquo;s no point backing up very big files which changes virtually never.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s best to do in that case is to just synchronize them with Amazon S3 and take regular back ups of everything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, and it works &ndash; it&rsquo;s great.&nbsp; So I use your&hellip; and I&rsquo;ve got a few other WordPress sites.&nbsp; Akeeba Pro is going to back up these WordPress sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;This could be very interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;We started, I started a little discussion in the Square One Google Group thinking you know this is a novelty, it&rsquo;s fun, I&rsquo;m just going to say you know my first install and somebody replied &ldquo;oh that was interesting&rdquo;. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes it&rsquo;s very interesting.&nbsp; Actually you may have answered one, let&rsquo;s say one feature request that I have from a few clients if it&rsquo;s possible to create a standalone version of Akeeba Backup because this is pretty much what you created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So I put, well I think I should look at the Joomla Platform and see if I can make some sort of app for it that I could put on.&nbsp; You know, I&rsquo;m not there yet, I&rsquo;ve got other things to do, but we&rsquo;ll get some sort of distro for Akeeba Pro to back up WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s actually something that should be possible in a few months.&nbsp; There are quite a few features that I want to implement if I have adequate time to do that, that is.&nbsp; What I want to do is allow you to select what is going to be the root of the site that you are backing up, the database connection to the site that you are backing up so practically you can have one Joomla site backing up a WordPress site and of course I have to create some platform classes for WordPress and an installer for WordPress, because right now if you try to restore that backup you are going to need a lot of nano-tracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re going to be up nights, the devil&rsquo;s going to be in the details with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;I know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always thought of taking a look at what is required to create a WordPress backup but &hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I thought all we have to really do is I just thought, here&rsquo;s a fun exercise &ndash; what do I really need in Joomla to run the administrator &ndash; and then start deleting.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what somebody said &ndash; you delete this.&nbsp; I said well I don&rsquo;t want to destroy the Square One upgrade, but maybe we could do another build where there&rsquo;s practically no front end and we just put that piece in under a subdirectory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s all possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and then load yours and it&rsquo;s the just back end because we forget about the front end and I kept that to myself &ndash; I wanted to try that first before mentioning it so I just destroyed that.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s great &ndash; yeah I&rsquo;ve got it backing up a WordPress site for real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s interesting, that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, how about that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a very interesting use case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;All I had to do was delete the root index.php and it overwrote the robots.txt file.&nbsp; Those were the only file contentions that I had and I&rsquo;m using the latest WordPress 3.whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t suppose that you could actually delete the components directory from the root.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You know and I almost used your Admin Tools to update the Joomla before I realized, &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m in Square One, can&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;! [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, that would be a very bad idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Turn brain on, don&rsquo;t do that!&nbsp; So, that&rsquo;s another interesting issue about the Distro that I put in the back of my mind.&nbsp; So, we&rsquo;re a little over but thank you so much Nicholas for coming on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong>&nbsp;You are welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll have you on again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(53, 89, 3, 'Tbbs49', '<p>Welcome to the 49th &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, March 22nd, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Today I have the pleasure of talking to Joe LeBlanc. Joe, first time here, thank you for taking the time to be here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for having me and at last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes at last. I want to tell you that I went to the Joomla and Beyond website and I see you&rsquo;re a keynote speaker.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re going to talk about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;So, what I really want to talk about is just taking a look at what other Open Source projects do and how they handle different problems that we run into in the Joomla community.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been taking a look at some different systems this year, like I did a Google Plus post a little bit earlier this year talking about some of the other things I&rsquo;m looking at &ndash; like Ruby on Rails and Druple and just a few other software packages that are out there because they all are focused on solving this web problem that we&rsquo;re all facing.&nbsp; You know we&rsquo;ve got to create a website and deal with Javascript and CSS and database queries and all the things that come together to make our website and a lot of these other projects have come with a lot of tools that we should be looking at when we&rsquo;re building Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just like one big cross pollination thing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s, we don&rsquo;t want to go around reinventing the wheel and I think there is a lot of things that we can learn from other projects even if we can&rsquo;t directly use the code that they&rsquo;re using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I don&rsquo;t want you to give away what you&rsquo;re going to say.&nbsp; I just didn&rsquo;t quite understand from the write-up on the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re the first person in the Joomla world that I met through Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s because you wrote the book called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Learning-Joomla-1-5-Extension-Development/dp/1847196209/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332253841&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Learning Joomla! 1.5 Extension Development  on Amazon\">Learning Joomla! 1.5 Extension Development</a>. So, my question is what motivated you to author the book?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;I was actually approached by the author of the book.&nbsp; The whole story behind this was I was working a job and decided to quit and didn&rsquo;t really have anything lined up after that and on the very last day of work the final contract for this book came through and so I just spent the next little while writing the book while I was doing some freelance work and you know, just kind of hung tight there for a little bit while I wrote the book and got another job and then it got published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m not the only one who met you through Amazon by the way.&nbsp; I hear it quite a bit.&nbsp; I appreciate it that you offered the code samples for download, because that was a big help for me.&nbsp; It also reinforced the idea that the way to learn is to look at the code.&nbsp; Something about it being Open Source?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you graduated with a Bachelor of&nbsp; Science&nbsp; in Management Information Systems.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking that sounds like you should be deep within Corporate IT, so how did you end up with Joomla?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Happy accident. [laughter] I started looking for work during my senior year of college and it was still kind of rough, I mean, the after affects of the dot com crash were still being felt but things were beginning to turn around a little bit and I just started looking for work and found some part-time contract work with someone who wanted to use Mambo to power all his websites and there weren&rsquo;t really any tutorials on how to write code for Mambo at the time. So I just started tearing Mambo apart and looking at how it was built; and, then finally wrote a tutorial on how to create a Mambo component and then it was just all downhill after there.&nbsp; People just started hitting my website like crazy and I was hooked on freelancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And your book which I&rsquo;m holding in my hand is subtitled &ldquo;A Practical Tutorial&rdquo; so I guess you&rsquo;re used to writing about tutorials in that style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I like teaching, I really do and I like doing things where I can show it used in a sentence &ndash; I don&rsquo;t like Hello World or anything like that.&nbsp; I want to show kind of a practical example of how you can use that code to solve a problem that you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Did you find that your book helped your freelancing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Oh definitely.&nbsp; There were lots of people that found my book and wanted me to do work for them.&nbsp; Although immediately after the book was launched I was actually working for a contractor at the Federal Aviation Administration in DC and so that was really keeping me busy for the first couple of years after the book was launched and then after that just all the while I was working there people were contacting me and wanting me to do work for them but that definitely helped when I decided to leave the FAA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Not just left the FAA, you left Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp; I left the FAA first though and still had another year or two there in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You went from Tweeting about where you were having a snack or something in Washington and then that all just stopped on Twitter. Just like overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have attended a lot of Joomla events. Is it like if you&rsquo;ve seen one, you&rsquo;ve seen them all?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s interesting because while a lot of the Joomla Days do have kind of the same feel to them, you still have, I say as you go to the different locations you have the different user groups and kind of their personalities come through.&nbsp; I love going to Joomla Day New England, I went there once and spoke and if you go up there they just have a solid crew that is very much into Joomla and is very excited about building websites and they all just live in little towns in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts and it&rsquo;s just a lot of fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;They have a Joomla day coming up in two weeks, right? The last weekend of this month?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/author/jwilken\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jeremy Wilken\'s profile\">Jeremy&nbsp;</a>will be there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I find it curious that this web project Joomla where people from all over the world work on it have a visceral need&nbsp; to meet face to face and this is the most important thing to know about these Joomla events?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;I think so.&nbsp; You do learn what the presenters are teaching and you do have some interaction where you&rsquo;re sitting down and just talking through different problems with people but I think the most important part is just to meet people that you&rsquo;re interacting with on-line because there is so much that doesn&rsquo;t transfer over the internet as far as socialization goes.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s vocal tone and body language and a lot of culture that just kind of gets erased when you&rsquo;re on-line.&nbsp; I mean the flip side of doing things on-line though is that you get to meet people from all over the world that you probably wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise, but at the same time you need that time, that facetime with people so that you can just learn a little bit more about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m here nodding my head.&nbsp; Even doing the podcasts and hearing somebody talk is different from reading a blog post that they wrote about the same thing we&rsquo;re talking about.&nbsp; It conveys something different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I noticed today at lunch time that you had just released Podcast Suite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I decided to create my own Media website, I took a long look at your extension which was called Podcast Suite. You had stopped working on that extension at the time so I was considering tweaking it and maybe just releasing it to the public.&nbsp; I remember I contacted you about it and you said &ldquo;sure, whatever&rdquo; [laughter] and I did something. You&rsquo;re talking about the different projects I sat down with Druple and I said &ldquo;forget it&rdquo;; and then, I sat down with WordPress and WordPress just seemed to have a lot out of the box, they&rsquo;ve got something called PowerPress which is aligned with someone&rsquo;s business but obviously I went with WordPress and it just seemed better suited, so I&rsquo;m glad I sent you the Show Notes first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why did you create Podcast Suite in the first place, and then how come you stopped working on it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;So we&rsquo;re back when podcasting was really new, I mean this is back in late 2004, it was still the Mambo days and I was beginning to hear about podcasts and began to subscribe to a few and I was thinking &ndash; what do I need to do to get podcasting into Mambo. And how can I make Mambo the best platform for publishing a podcast? and it turned out that for the most part the only thing that was missing was the enclosure tag in RSS feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;To get it to &hellip;.. sorry for interrupting &hellip;.. for the RSS feeds and also for iTunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, well this was before iTunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It was? Wow, I didn&rsquo;t realize it went back that far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah, it started, if anybody was around then there was this guy Adam Currie who did a lot of the spearheading of the whole podcasting format and before Apple got into it it was very much a community driven thing and it still is, but we didn&rsquo;t really have iTunes to catch the podcasts and to download automatically to your iPod, and it was all done through a lot of the different scripts and things that people cooked up to make it work and so I wanted to be part of this community and I wanted to make it just brilliantly simple for someone to publish a podcast for Mambo and at the time all it was was just adding a tag into that RSS feed and you were pretty much good to go and so I got that out pretty quickly.&nbsp; I forked the com_syndicate component for Mambo and just added in the pieces that we needed to make it do podcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Those were the days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah and that was Podcast Suite.&nbsp; You know I had that and then a plug-in and a module, so it was the three kind of major extension types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So you had an on again/off again with Podcast Suite &ndash; I had no idea.&nbsp; Because when I picked it up it was not like Mambo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Right, so I still worked on Podcast Suite and then Adam Currie convinced Apple to add podcasting support for iTunes so that you could subscribe to podcasts directly in iTunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It will never work. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Right. So it exploded and iTunes is now essentially the de facto podcatcher, I guess as people would call it.&nbsp; It is really simple to just go through and search for podcasts and subscribe and you don&rsquo;t have to even think about RSS or anything and all these podcasts just magically appear on your iPhone now.&nbsp; As that happened Apple also added just a ton of new tags to the RSS feed that you need to add to make things appear attractive in their Podcast Directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right and before you were trying to pull info from the Joomla database as it was, like from the article, and with iTunes there are so many specific XML tags &ndash; where do you put them [oops, I mean &ldquo;where do you get the info within Joomla for these Apple-specific XML tags&rdquo; -Bob]?&nbsp; So when I looked at your Podcast Suite I remember there was a few more tags or whatever because you had stopped development I would have had to put in and there was nowhere on the Joomla article where this info would have been.&nbsp; So I could just see you pulling your hair out over this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;What I really wanted to accomplish with Podcast Suite was just a very thin layer over the core content management so that you weren&rsquo;t managing this enormous component to handle a lot of different things at once and that you put in a little tag and you just ran with it.&nbsp; That was the idea behind Podcast Suite. But the very concept that podcasting has now really I would say evolved because now it&rsquo;s not even just iTunes but people are very much into the front end of the podcasting, you know how the podcasting looks on the website. Because there are tons of people who listen to podcasts and never subscribe.&nbsp; They just go to the website and start playing it because they see a player there. So that&rsquo;s part of what we&rsquo;ve done with Podcast Suite 2.0 is we&rsquo;ve really reworked it to work with that newer concept of what a podcast is and to help people display their podcasts on their website rather than just syndicate it off iTunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a few things happening.&nbsp; You have to get the podcast to iTunes, so you do that.&nbsp; You also want to get it into an RSS feed which is not necessarily iTunes, so there&rsquo;s that.&nbsp; You also want to include a player so that the MP3 just shows up in the article.&nbsp; And you said something else &ndash; how it looks on the site, so it sounds like you&rsquo;re going to have a module &ndash; I have not looked at your Podcast Suite 2.0 &ndash; you just released it an hour or two ago.&nbsp; I assume that there is a module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Actually there is no module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;There is a module that can display a few podcasts in the player.&nbsp; Sorry, you&rsquo;re thinking about how to present it on the site as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually not a module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;The approach that we&rsquo;ve taken now is the Podcast Suite now has more of a front end to it so you can list all your podcasts in one place without necessarily creating even articles now.&nbsp; So that has all the players that you&nbsp; need and then if you do want to use an article or you do want to imbed an episode in a module you could use the editor tabs that will place a specific episode in that module or that article.&nbsp; So now we&rsquo;ve bundled a copy of JPlayer and that is what we&rsquo;re using at the moment as the front end player and we have more plans in the works as far as that goes, but at the moment we have that working and it is just working right out of the box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and the extension is free but the support is commercial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Actually we have changed it.&nbsp; It is now a commercial extension and so when you buy it you do get the support and you do get updates for however long you subscribe to the extension.&nbsp; So that is how Podcast Suite is now moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So it&rsquo;s a premium extension?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, and there were six month duration and 12 month or something like that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You have to give me at least 2 hours notice. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;No worries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to sell this as I&rsquo;m always on the bleeding edge &ndash; right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sort of reticent because you said something about the Square One.&nbsp; I did see that the site that the new PodcastSuite.com is built on Square One.&nbsp; I think there was a tweet on that.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s working out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yup. Yeah we, Jeremy and I, mainly Jeremy right now is working on Square One and I&rsquo;m getting a little bit more involved with it too and we&rsquo;re very happy with what Jeremy&rsquo;s been able to accomplish in a pretty short period of time and we&rsquo;re looking forward to doing more work with Square One and using it as a way of testing out new features and things we can bring back to the Joomla community at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t quite realize that you guys are connected through your connection at Cory Web.&nbsp; Both of you joined there recently and it&rsquo;s through Cory Web that Podcast Suite is being developed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://corywebbmedia.com/news/item/52-joe-leblanc-joins-the-cory-webb-media-team\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Joe LeBlanc joins Cory Webb Media\">Joe LeBlanc joins Cory Webb Media</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://corywebbmedia.com/news/item/55-jeremy-wilken-joins-the-cory-webb-media-team\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jeremy Wilken joins Cory Webb Meda\">Jeremy Wilken joins Cory Webb Media</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s what I read, and because of that and I see you&rsquo;re chiming in on the Square One Google Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So, it&rsquo;s all, I&rsquo;m having Jeremy on next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;So you can see all the connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So it&rsquo;s all connected. So I thought we&rsquo;d talk about Podcast Suite and then Square One, it will sort of be just one big continuous conversation.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here stumbling through&nbsp; my notes.&nbsp; Actually you said something on the Square One Google Group that had me going to those websites about package management and that&rsquo;s what I didn&rsquo;t quite understand what you were all getting at so I was hoping that &ndash; I thought when Jeremy comes on I&rsquo;ll ask him about it.&nbsp; But I really like what you said even though I didn&rsquo;t quite understand it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, there&rsquo;s a couple of different concepts floating around out there and one of them is more generalized package management for PHP and if you take a look at packages.org, that is a project that&rsquo;s designed to be kind of a generic package manager for PHP itself.&nbsp; And that way if you have a lot of dependencies for your software you don&rsquo;t actually have to bundle those dependencies with your software, you just have to have packages there and tell it it to go fetch everything for you.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s kind of something I&rsquo;d like to see in Square One and I know Jeremy is working on doing things as bundles, for lack of a better term, where you might say all these different extensions go together and I want blogging set up.&nbsp; So that would go and install some of your extensions that would help you get a blog up and running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Uhm hum.&nbsp; And if you had just released an extension and you did the website on the Square One and you would end up maybe doing a distro of Square One with Podcast Suite on it or with it on the XML for the updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I like that.&nbsp; See it&rsquo;s just one big continuous conversation.&nbsp; We should split this into a two-part &ndash; we&rsquo;re already at the 25 minute mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;For the second part, you have a tutorial that you did on<a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/Joseph-LeBlanc/136-1.html?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=ldc_affiliate&amp;utm_content=vanityurl&amp;utm_campaign=CD23&amp;aid=CD23\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Joe LeBlanc tutorials on Lynda.com\">Lynda.com</a>&nbsp;and I wanted to talk about that. So we&rsquo;ll see you in Part 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;All right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>This is Bob Bloom, signing off part 1 of my interview with Joe LeBlanc, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, March 22nd, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;50th show.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;m supposed to get a gold watch or something. [laughter] I have the pleasure of talking with Joe LeBlanc today.&nbsp; This is the second of a two part interview [<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/tbbs49\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Throwing the Book at Joe LeBlanc, Part 1 of 2\">Part One</a>] and it&rsquo;s Joe&rsquo;s first time here and I hope not your last.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to be here today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for interviewing me Bob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Again, Joe&rsquo;s my first guest who I ever met at Amazon.ca through his book that he wrote for Joomla 1.5 called &ldquo;Learning Joomla 1.5 Extension Development&rdquo;.&nbsp; I think everybody who was learning 1.5 got that book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were talking about the new Podcast Suite which you just released today or last week.&nbsp; [laughter] Welcome to amateur radio!&nbsp; I also talked about your Joomla and Beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to chime in with would I ever switch my media site back to Joomla?&nbsp; and the answer I think it might be coming one day, it would be a bit of a job.&nbsp; The thing about Podcast Suite that interests me is its ability to combine with e-commerce sites or with what I want to do. I think that everybody who runs a niche e-commerce site should podcast because it&rsquo;s not enough to blog.&nbsp; Blog doesn&rsquo;t get you onto iTunes, just like a blog doesn&rsquo;t get you onto You Tube &ndash; so you have to have a mix of video and podcasting so that you get in all the different venues and nobody does both &ndash; you&rsquo;re lucky to get someone who does one and this might spur that and I think it would be a real help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be a real trick to get the player in the check out and at different parts of the check out there are audio cues or even videos of when you go through check out so it would be interesting to see where conventionally plug in the different parts of your Podcast Suite into it because everyone can end up at iTunes anyways.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s my little shpiel there.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all one big platform, it&rsquo;s not really, you know you need all the different media.&nbsp; Again it just came out hours ago so I haven&rsquo;t looked at the new version.&nbsp; So you did write the book and when 2.5 was coming out you did a tutorial for Lynda.com and I wanted you to compare the two ways of teaching a book versus these on-line tutorials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I know a lot of people have come back to me and said you know when are you doing the book?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t ruled it out entirely.&nbsp; I mean we definitely get a benefit with the book where you know, you&rsquo;re not fixed there on the screen watching every minute and every second and you can bookmark things and kind of peruse at your own pace.&nbsp; But at the same time with the video it&rsquo;s much easier, I think, for me to show you a complete concept of something at once and I think that going through the video is ultimately much more time effective than going through a book.&nbsp; At the same time it does have benefits and drawbacks I would say.&nbsp; On my end it&rsquo;s very much easier to record a video than write a book.&nbsp; I think something about that video format just forces you to stay on topic and to get everything working as one kind of complete thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So as somebody producing it your video seems better now than just doing a book?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Like I said, it&rsquo;s kind of a, there&rsquo;s definitely some advantages to the book format but I really do like doing the videos for lynda.com and they&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m putting you on the spot!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah &ndash; [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think the book is good as a reference, but I really like was that you had code there, that I could download the code and it was interactive and I could compare the code subsequently with what I saw other people doing because it is Open Source you can compare the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;That is also the case with lynda.com though &ndash; if you do the premium subscription you get the code, and you not only get the code but you get the exact code I was using in the video so if you are interested in Chapter 8, Video 3, you can get that exercise file from lynda.com and see the exact code I was working with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;And when there is updates the book is impossible to update &ndash; you have to republish and the book in my hand is going to be out of date.&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;re doing something online then it can be more topical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;[big sigh] ehhh, I think there&rsquo;s, I just fear the death of the book.&nbsp; Even the search &ndash; how do you search a book?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;The Jenkins &ndash; the definitive guide to Jenkins I was shocked to see that there is a 400 plus page book that&rsquo;s about $40 &ndash; is a free PDF.&nbsp; The advantage to the PDF is I can search it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t search the book by putting in a key word.&nbsp; [big sigh] I&rsquo;m asking you a question and I have definitive opinions on what I want the answer to be.&nbsp; [laughter]&nbsp; I just think that it&rsquo;s better &ndash; it&rsquo;s just better to have a website, have a series of tutorials and stuff on and make it a membership site, then stratify it to the different types of readers you have, but it&rsquo;s just a lot of work to set that up.&nbsp; I thought you&rsquo;d be great at that.&nbsp; [big sigh] So what else can I ask you that&rsquo;s not controversial? or didn&rsquo;t come out so fast.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well there&rsquo;s something &ndash; you just joined CoryWebb and are you able to talk about the motivations behind that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, yeah. So, I moved here to Austin last June and I&rsquo;ve been freelancing for a while &ndash; I&rsquo;ve gone back and forth between full-time jobs and freelancing and I&rsquo;ve worked with Cory in the past and I&rsquo;ve even subcontracted some things out to him and he&rsquo;s subcontracted things out to me and we talked about doing more of a full-time arrangement in the past and just the timing and everything just kind of came together and when I got here in Austin I was doing a contract, kind of a joint project with him and we just decided to go full-time so this past October was my first official day with Cory Webb Media and we&rsquo;ve been just kind of pooling our resources and our client bases and it&rsquo;s very good to have other people that you can work with, I would say it&rsquo;s just, I love doing Joomla programming but I can&rsquo;t do everything and I very much appreciate having James and Jeremy and Cory to work with and we&rsquo;re all good at different things and we just bring it all to the table and that&rsquo;s how we do work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and who&rsquo;s James?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;James Hefner &ndash; he is a front end developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;because Cory I know the name and of course Jeremy I had on my show &ndash; he was my 2012 interview, and you &ndash; so I know three of the four people.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s smart to not try to be solo on these extensions because the scope of the extensions grows and the support could &ndash; I&rsquo;ve done so many shows on the support &ndash; it&rsquo;s a real hornet&rsquo;s nest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Um hum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So, I think it&rsquo;s a good way to deliver extensions because it&rsquo;s just getting &ndash; it&rsquo;s a bigger enterprise to deliver extensions than it used to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. I think I remember seeing a tweet from Steve Burge talking a little bit about how he was seeing a lot of consolidation happening in the Joomla world in the next year or two and that was a year ago and it&rsquo;s definitely happening if you look around a lot of people are joining forces and bringing what they&rsquo;re good at and joining it with other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You know I don&rsquo;t want to get my butt kicked on this but it was public domain that I don&rsquo;t know, there was Morph is partnering with someone to get it&rsquo;s 2.5 version out and I think that the, it&rsquo;s just the investment in writing the extensions and maintaining them, supporting them, it&rsquo;s just a bigger investment than it was in the old days of Joomla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and you have to, it takes a while to get a return but there is a certain uncertainty with what you&rsquo;re working with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah and at the same time I think we&rsquo;re just seeing a maturing of the Joomla market, more people are using it, more large names are using it and it&rsquo;s becoming more popular and at the same time that increases the demand for support and for just the ability for your extension to work in many different environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and in conjunction with whatever else they&rsquo;re installing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re probably going to have a few support about the RSS feeds because that was always an issue wasn&rsquo;t it? In Joomla?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re doing our own RSS generation through Joomla and we&rsquo;re not using the core Joomla RSS generation so I think we pretty much have that nailed down now.&nbsp; Like we went through very meticulously through Apple&rsquo;s documentation and made sure we had all their tags in place and we also have not just the RSS feed but also the players are in standard Joomla MP3 layout so if there is something there that you don&rsquo;t want or you want to change it&rsquo;s as easy as creating a template override and you can just change it.&nbsp; So if you want a different player you can add your own in, we&rsquo;re not including the call for the Javascript happens on that layout page so if you&rsquo;re not using the JPlayer it won&rsquo;t get included if you remove it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I&rsquo;m glad you brought that up, I didn&rsquo;t want to ask. What happens if you have another plug-in that&rsquo;s calling another one.&nbsp; The scenario is you have an MP3 but you don&rsquo;t want it in the RSS feed or in iTunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;In that situation actually of the features we have now is we&rsquo;ve separated out the episodes from the media so you can add one or more media items to your episodes and you can handle those media items separately.&nbsp; So if you just want to play, if you want to upload a media item and play that standalone and not add it to an RSS feed, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s now possible with Podcast Suite 2.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll have to take a look at this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I like the sound of that, that was a problem.&nbsp; I have to be careful, you know I solved the problem by not having any MP3&rsquo;s &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t want on iTunes anyways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Well there was a tag in the older version where you could just say player and then the name of the file and then it would look in your podcast directory and use the player but that probably was a little bit less than intuitive for the way everything was built.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve really revamped the UI and we&rsquo;ve tried to make it as self explanatory as possible and for the rest we have documentation that&rsquo;s now available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;ve looked at Feedburner?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;At the moment it&rsquo;s pretty much still, we generate the RSS feed and you can feed it through Feedburner if you want but there&rsquo;s no integration with Feedburner beyond that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;No messing around with .htaccess or something?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;The last time I looked at that stuff was at least two years ago, so I&rsquo;m probably out of date on that.&nbsp; That was just eye glazing to look at the documentation on that. [laughter] There&rsquo;s so many permutations now with the podcasting &ndash; just the PowerPress, the new version they&rsquo;ve got so many tabs and one of them&rsquo;s for TV or something, geez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Like I said though, the whole concept of podcasting has just evolved and everybody has a different idea of how it works and we&rsquo;re trying to cater, I guess you would say, a plurality of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You know, I&rsquo;m assuming because I don&rsquo;t do video podcasts, I assume that Podcast Suite is just for audio, but maybe I should ask if it&rsquo;s for video as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;The JPlayer plug-in that we&rsquo;re using actually does support video and so Podcast Suite does support video and audio and actually one of the very specific features that we have in this version allows you to have an audio file and a video file that are both attached to the same episode and then that way if you have an audio version and a video version you don&rsquo;t have to type in the same episode information twice.&nbsp; So that way you can then generate different feeds for those different formats as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s huge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, because one issue that we&rsquo;ve run into is a lot of churches actually will podcast their sermons and a lot of them will want to do both an audio and a video version of that.&nbsp; I know the church that I was a part of in Washington, DC would just record the video and then scrub the audio into a separate file and then that way they were only producing &ndash; they were using the same source material but they were just generating different formats for it.&nbsp; So with Podcast Suite 2.0 you could now generate two separate feeds for the same content and everything, just in different formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think a sermon is the reason, although I should call some of my podcasts sermons.&nbsp; [laughter] Thanks for laughing.&nbsp; The problem is the device and that some devices don&rsquo;t show video and if you only have video you&rsquo;ve cut off or even for people who have video, like I&rsquo;m not really that interested on my iPhone to subscribe to a video podcast if there&rsquo;s audio because most of the time I&rsquo;m not going to be staring at my screen anyways, so this is a very important feature so I&rsquo;m glad we did two parts so that we could get to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Is there anything that I missed that you wanted to talk about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s mainly it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time and put in a lot of hard work in making Podcast Suite 2.0 the best podcasting extension for Joomla and we have ideas already in the hopper for version 3.0, so keep watching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m steering clear of getting deeper into Square One on purpose because things are cooking there and when Jeremy comes on I want to give him a clean shot at explaining.&nbsp; You probably have some inside info because you&rsquo;re connected with him and I kind of see where.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so fascinated that you&rsquo;ve built your Podcast Suite.com on Square One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, we did it that way because we really wanted to make a statement saying that this is software you should use and it&rsquo;s stable and ready to go and it&rsquo;s Joomla, it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;ve taken away some of the features that we&rsquo;re not using for every website and added a few features that we wanted and that&rsquo;s really it and I will let Jeremy talk about that when you have him on next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;because it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to do a distro that could really make that powerful.&nbsp; Just thinking about my site.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d love to see the individual extension purveyors do their own podcast of their extensions &ndash; like Anahita does the Hangout and I started the LaSalle Mart thing which is &hellip;.. but I&rsquo;d love to see more of that and this would be a great entree on how to do it in Joomla.&nbsp; Have a nice little compact separate site for it.&nbsp; So, I think you&rsquo;re onto something &ndash; I love it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So we&rsquo;re just a shy bit under the 25 minutes, but we&rsquo;ll wrap it up now before I get into conversations that would need a part 3. [laughter] I am so thrilled that you were able to come on here and finally be able to talk to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been too long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;and for Podcast Suite for the follow-up, I&rsquo;ll have you on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Alright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;For Square One, or maybe I&rsquo;ll have both of you on and have you go at it together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But definitely have you on again this year.&nbsp; Thank you Joe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(55, 91, 3, 'Tbbs51', '<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Welcome to the 51st &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, April 26th, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I&rsquo;m going heads down getting LaSalleMart 1.0 out, this is my last podcast before June. Although I&rsquo;ll probably have one podcast about LaSalleMart in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My intention was to record a two part interview without actually splitting up our interview into two podcasts. Better to keep things flowing than to interrupt, when I have Ash and Rastin here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I was so caught off-guard by our topic toward the end of our interview, that I am showcasing that discussion in a<a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/tbbs52\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Starting Up with Ash and Rastin, Part 2 of 2\">separate podcast</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every three months or so, Arash Sanieyan and Rastin Mehr join me. I always look forward to our shows. How are you today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Pretty good thank you, how about you Bob?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, I&rsquo;m just swell thanks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Rastin and Ash are the core architects of the Anahita Social Engine which is available at their site,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://anahitapolis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anahitapolis.com\">Anahitapolis.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January, I wrote a blog post called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://blog.southlasallecommerce.com/2012/critical-lessons-learned-from-2011\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Critical Lessons Learned from 2011\">Critical Lessons Learned from 2011</a>&ldquo;. My featured image is the Anahitapolis logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ash, Rastin, you&rsquo;ve taught me a lot, thank you!&nbsp; I want to talk about what you&rsquo;ve taught me. Some of it we&rsquo;ve talked about in previous podcasts, but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind reviewing, because they are important lessons and I wanted to get your impressions of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things that Ash &amp; Rastin have taught me:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Open source software must be intermediated &mdash; that is open source software is raw material.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; Well&nbsp;<em>I can&rsquo;t imagine it not be</em>&nbsp;and open source software is in our case we use open source software as raw material.&nbsp; We have a project and we do use other open source projects in our code, but a lot of the time&nbsp;<em>we only take what we need rather than just including everything that they provide</em>&nbsp;and in some rare cases we do, let&rsquo;s say if we need everything they built, we do include them.&nbsp; But to build a light and lean system for us it worked a lot better to just only take what we need and also feel free to change it, to make it suit your needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think&nbsp; intermediation is important because the risk of using open source software is on the user and so it&rsquo;s an extreme risk but it&rsquo;s offset by the reward of controlling the code; and, you always demonstrate that you take in code and you change it for your purposes, fix things up and then you put it in &ndash; into Anahita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it&rsquo;s true what you&rsquo;re saying &ndash; there is a risk, but there again there is this&nbsp;<em>battle between a really end product and what is basically a raw material for another project that you do</em>.&nbsp; Most of the libraries that we use are sort of like intermediary libraries that we use for building Anahita.&nbsp; One special case of Anahita is that it can be viewed as both ways:&nbsp; [Anahita] can be used by you as something that is done as an end product; or, [Anahita] can be viewed as something that is in the middle of another end product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to build a social network for yourself and you use Anahita and then you need to customize it.&nbsp; So for Anahita there is always that case that some people wanted as an end product that I just wanted everything to work and there are some people that want to be able to do some level of customization.&nbsp; So, it&rsquo;s something that you always think about when you&rsquo;re building any features for Anahita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a big thing &ndash; is it an end product or not? But open source software that is an end product &ndash; it&rsquo;s still available to be massaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Those are the rights the GPL gives you, that you have the freedom to read and modify and redistribute&nbsp; the code which is essential</em>.&nbsp; But as Ash said, it could be risky.&nbsp; You have to know what you&rsquo;re doing when you change a code.&nbsp; In our case Anahita is provided as a platform and framework to people.&nbsp; We do have a consistent API for people if they want to build a project using Anahita,&nbsp;<em>the best approach is that they follow the Anahita API rather than the API of let&rsquo;s say, one of the technologies used in Anahita and that way we take care of a lot of the changes that we have to do</em>&nbsp;but at the same time we try to be as consistent as possible when it gets into the Anahita API, so peoples&rsquo; projects don&rsquo;t break.&nbsp; Ash do you want to add to that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, yeah basically you just explained what I just said I don&rsquo;t know what to say. [laughter]&nbsp; Basically the more you stick to the public API (if you want to call it), it depends on how advanced you are, you should be able to use anything you want, this is your own platform when you download it, you should be able to do anything you want.&nbsp; Sticking to the public API or the things that we use, for example between me and Rastin I have some API&rsquo;s that only I use and I tell Rastin &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use these ones because I might change it in the near future&rdquo;, so even in our apps we try to use as much of official API&rsquo;s as possible and keep some of the ones that are so private and might change, I don&rsquo;t use it as much.&nbsp; So, if you stick to those it&rsquo;s easier to upgrade, obviously, but then again if you are a hacker that doesn&rsquo;t matter, that&rsquo;s the whole idea of being a hacker, you go there and you use whatever tools necessary that you want to do.&nbsp; So it really depends on how advanced you are in terms of being a hacker so you can start with the public API connection, dig in and use anything you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I think the topic came, we better go back to the roots of the word what caused that line that you know, anytime you used a lot of open source projects as raw material. What we offer to people is Anahita and Anahita right now uses a little bit of Joomla code, uses Nooku framework, uses Bootstrap, uses Gantry and over time we add or remove different technologies to Anahita but&nbsp;<em>what people get at the end is Anahita</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when you add these&nbsp;<em>building blocks and ingredients</em>&nbsp;to people, we don&rsquo;t just add them as they are.&nbsp; We maintain the freedom to make changes or only take what we need.&nbsp; The problem was that some people in the community they wanted full compatibility with the technology that is used as an ingredient and that is not we are necessarily interested or want because our goal is here to deliver Anahita as the best social networking platform or framework there is and not something else.&nbsp; Now, because let&rsquo;s say Joomla is a CMS or Nooku Framework out there is a great wave application platform or Gantry is a template framework mainly built for Joomla CMS and for us to deliver Anahita sometimes we use ingredients from other projects but we don&rsquo;t use them exactly as they are because they may not apply to our goal and<strong>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s where the freedom of open source comes handy that you can take what you need, you can read the code, you can change, you can modify, you can redistribute</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I think this glides into the next thing you&rsquo;ve taught me.&nbsp; Because since being able to change the code is important:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Users must be connected to the code by picking up technical skills; or, by associating with people who can do things with code.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You wrote that wonderful blog post and you stuck that right in the middle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got that link somewhere else on my site. Why users should be connected to the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I believe if I remember that was about going back to whether you are building a point and click product or a product that is customizable by code &ndash; right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You were actually describing&hellip; that was the myths of Anahita and right in the middle you described hackerpreneur which at first doesn&rsquo;t seem like it has anything to do with the myths of Anahita but you said that the kinds of people who were attracted to use Anahita were hackerpreneurs, and hackerpreneurs either knew enough about technology or associated themselves with people who knew about the technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a mouthful!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I suppose, again, another approach we took, right now social networking is a really hot topic &ndash; everything on the web is becoming social and there are a lot of technologies out there that promise you a social networking out of the box and a lot of them are products that basically mimic the behaviour of Facebook and you can customize them using point and clicking tools.&nbsp; So essentially you get a product that comes loaded with so many features and then you switch off the ones that you don&rsquo;t need and you only use what&rsquo;s left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with that approach is that over time it gets really really bloated because they tried to build something that is for everybody, they tried to be everything to everybody, not to mention a lot of them are also built on a very network architecture.&nbsp; Our approach was to only provide the foundations and the basic building blocks and people were building projects &ndash; they only add what they need and so that&rsquo;s one approach to make a light system and the other approach was sometimes it take really five lines of code or ten lines of code or 50 lines of code to get something done but if you want to do it the point and click way you have to write 3,000 lines of code or 1,000 lines of code.&nbsp; In that case it makes sense to actually sit down and write code rather than trying to build the whole system to customize using point and click approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, and for Anahita we took that approach.&nbsp; Anahita is customizable mainly by program, by code.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not point and click.&nbsp; So when people ask how can I make this change &ndash; we give them a snip of code and we don&rsquo;t tell them that code they are click on that press save and so for that purpose a lot of the people who are attracted to Anahita, they like the customization using programming. And, the fact that they can actually see the code, they can play around with it and understand how it works and do their own customization.&nbsp; Especially that in Anahita and also it uses Nooku Framework.&nbsp; You can override every class, every html layout, every CSS, everything is overrideable which is probably one of the most customizable solutions available in the market today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Did you want to add to that Ash?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;No. Rastin got everything. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Am I being very thorough?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;yes, that&rsquo;s very good.&nbsp; Well we say that all the time.&nbsp; The best example is I put an example the other day for adding custom fields, I put it actually on our Anahita GitHub, we started a GitHub repository for code examples.&nbsp; I mean we are talking about, it wasn&rsquo;t more than a few lines of code but it was about with the comments and everything it was about 40 lines of code and we added fields to groups and that was it.&nbsp; The thing is on a social network you don&rsquo;t go change around things like that.&nbsp; If you add a field to a group it&rsquo;s going to stay there for a while so if you do this once from performance perspective, from every part it&rsquo;s much better.&nbsp; But of course it&rsquo;s a lot harder for somebody who doesn&rsquo;t understand coding to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So if people learn that it&rsquo;s a lot more empowering because with 40 lines of code that we provided the code example they can actually add what they&rsquo;ve been wanting for a while.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;One thing is interesting that happens quite often in the community,&nbsp;<em>in Anahita you take less number of characters and words to write code than to complain about a lack of feature</em>and we often see someone comes and write 5,000 words that they could have solved that problem in 200 words and we remind them that listen, you would have been a lot faster if you just asked us how can I add this feature? How do I write the code and we just give you the code and it would have been less writing than this lengthy complaint letter, &ldquo;you know I&rsquo;m ticked off because this feature that I write for my specific project doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;One thing we&rsquo;ve got so good, I think actually that&rsquo;s a good thing is that,&nbsp;<em>I became so comfortable to basically provide code examples and quickly build prototypes for people.&nbsp; Anahita itself provides a lot of infrastructure to be able to do those fast and also it is actually easier for me to write the code example than trying to explain how to do things.</em>&nbsp; So I actually, if you notice on most of the topics, I ask people what is it and I quickly put a code example.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easier for me to write in code than to write in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s very hacker of Ash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;It becomes your second nature actually, you&rsquo;re trying to just show how it works and believe it or not&nbsp;<strong>when people actually start playing around with the code they actually feel a lot empowered, they feel good, they feel like they can control things and it&rsquo;s not that difficult &ndash; everybody can do it.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well you hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; There are a lot of people out there who won&rsquo;t cross the bridge, they want to be consumers and they want to consume the software but that&rsquo;s really not quite the nature of Open Source.&nbsp; Not that I&rsquo;m going to change My SQL or Apache but for the other stuff that I use, you know sometimes the stuff comes incomplete.&nbsp; People who want it to be consumer anyways are always messing around or hiring people, so I just think it&rsquo;s like the&nbsp;<em>culture of Open Source</em>is everybody is technical or has to know somebody to get it where they want to go.&nbsp; But like you said once they feel comfortable enough with the code, they feel connected which leads me to the next thing that you taught me!&nbsp; We talked about this in December:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social networking environment to deliver services and support is better than conventional ticket systems and forums.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s just a better way of learning and feeling connected.&nbsp; Before I be quiet and give it over to you, you do something that&rsquo;s quite remarkable in that Anahitopolis you make yourself incredibly<em>accessible</em>&nbsp;<em>to the subscribers</em>&nbsp;and it makes me feel very powerful with Anahita 1.6 Embryo that I&rsquo;ve barely used but I know &ndash; no matter what I come across you&rsquo;re going to be there and I&rsquo;m going to be able to figure it out &ndash; so there!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m actually open to the big vista out there of, I&rsquo;ve barely used it but I don&rsquo;t care because whatever comes up I know that I can overcome it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It could be because we use the code ourselves first before handing it out to people.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s important to us.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to say we eat our own dog food because what we build is a lot better than dog food. [laughter] But I think it&rsquo;s important we primarily build to meet our own needs and then we make that generic and we provide that to people and we focus on building foundations and yes, a social networking environment is far superior to the traditional ticketing system or discussion board for providing support because a social network environment puts communication on steroids, also it provides mechanism to filter out junk or unwanted content and so imagine when you can provide support or ask for help the same way that you communicate with your friends on Facebook or twitter or other social networks, it&rsquo;s a lot easier and the communication is a lot more fluid so every morning I can just come have a look at my dashboard, quickly go through to get an idea about the personality of community at that moment and what&rsquo;s going on and whether everyone is stressed or everyone is happy or I can quickly see the theme of the day and it&rsquo;s a lot easier than the isolated one at a time environment of traditional help support system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, that&rsquo;s one and also I think it actually puts people out of the perspective that Anahitopolis is us vs communities &ndash; it&rsquo;s more about everybody together.&nbsp; Whenever I&rsquo;m on Anahitopolis I feel like just one of the people on there and there&rsquo;s so many conversations that started happening without me being involved with so which is basically what we want is people to connect and try to share their experience regarding writing codes or anything.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re just one of another people on the internet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m assuming this is how let&rsquo;s say Mark Zukerbook feels when he uses Facebook, I don&rsquo;t think he says &ldquo;oh this is all mine&rdquo;, he&rsquo;s just one of the people using the Facebook.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s actually one of the aspects that I liked about Anahitopolis is exactly that &ndash; it&rsquo;s a community of its own, everybody is doing what they want to do, well not what they want to do, but they&rsquo;re still connecting the way they wanted to connect and there are conversations happening between people which is basically what we&rsquo;re aiming for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Things on your site, just one of these pet peeves that I have is people saying &ldquo;you know that&rsquo;s not what this thread is for&rdquo;.&nbsp; That never happens on your site because a discussion leads to something else and then nobody says &ldquo;you know, I have to enforce these rules of how these threads are&rdquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very casual, respectful, a little open like that for wherever the conversation goes because it&rsquo;s incredible.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s incredible what a help, I know I&rsquo;m talking too much on the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rasin:</strong>&nbsp;No, I think that you&rsquo;ve pointed out, that&rsquo;s a very good point and I think on the traditional discussion boards.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the limitation of the medium because on the traditional discussion boards they define the categories and every topic is there and it&rsquo;s supposed to serve a purpose.&nbsp; You basically define what you want to talk about in advance and then you start a thread or a topic and you have to stay on topic versus on a social network, in the Anahita environment we are against any form of tree structure hierarchy. A social network does not have hierarchy in it, we only have&nbsp;<em>associations and relationships</em>.&nbsp; So, you can pretty much anywhere start a conversation and the conversation can find its own path and once especially we add folksonomy you can tag as you go and the overall topic is known after the conversation is done or it changes as it evolves and the thread grows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s very organic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the nature of it, but in a social network you can do that and then the next step is to build tools to be able to find those, then configuration and search tools to find this information.&nbsp; In a traditional discussion board, because it&rsquo;s a lot more rigid and it follows a tree structure categorization.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t go off topic or you can&rsquo;t even change slightly a bit because everybody, you have to decide in advance what you&rsquo;re going to talk about versus in the environment we are building for Anahita you start a topic and later as the topic grows it can belong to so many different categories.&nbsp; I can give an example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You described it better than I did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well, you did point out and it has been a difficulty for a lot of people coming from discussion boards or attaching a discussion board to a software that provides a user profile and in Anahita we don&rsquo;t have something called discussion boards, we have an app called topics but discussions can happen anywhere, so the whole concept of discussion boards now evolve into social networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob</strong>: I wanted to get into the next thing about what you&rsquo;ve taught me is<u>:</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>communication is important; and, communication is not just shilling your wares.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You blog, you tweet, you produce your groundbreaking Hangout podcasts, you do it regularly but you&rsquo;re not always selling what you&rsquo;re doing and that&rsquo;s your Hangouts, they&rsquo;re almost not selling anything &ndash; it&rsquo;s just the state of where it&rsquo;s at.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ve taught me that that&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s great. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think that the direct selling works and I don&rsquo;t think we are particularly good at that.&nbsp; The Hangouts became a good opportunity for us to share with the world about what really goes on in the premium tribes and the spirit of people and the fact that they are spontaneous.&nbsp; When we start a Hangout we don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to go, so that surprise element in it is pretty good and I think so far we&rsquo;ve covered so many interesting projects and topics there, so we really have fun with the Hangouts ourselves, I hope it&rsquo;s as interesting for people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But you know, you don&rsquo;t just get out there in front of people &ndash; you don&rsquo;t just get out there when something good is happening, you know if somebody says you know, this is taking too long or whatever, I mean you talk about it! And there&rsquo;s a lot of people who they only communicate when there&rsquo;s something positive and they want to sell it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve demonstrated that this is one way to do it, just keep communicating no matter what and be honest about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s a lot better to be honest about something realistic rather than trying to sugarcoat things, it especially never works in a medium such as ours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>A social network is a very democratic environment</em>&nbsp;and people can pretty much write everything they want on their profiles and as long as they are legal [laughter] so that part, yeah communication is definitely the key but&nbsp;<em>we are not here to control people, we are here to nurture a community</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash &amp; Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Hello, hello are you there? I think we lost Bob. Can you hear me Ash?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Can you hear me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash &amp; Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, hi Bob.&nbsp; I think we lost you for a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Oh you lost me &ndash; I just knocked over my Blue microphone and it knocked out of Skype!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh my goodness.&nbsp; I heard the bang and _____ working for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It happens to all great podcasters [sure! -Bob].&nbsp; Was it Leo Laporte who the exercise ball exploded.&nbsp; The exercise ball just exploded.&nbsp; I think this is your Leo Laporte moment Bob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well you know, I&rsquo;m honoured.&nbsp; Can you hear me now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;I just loved that point &ndash; I swept my hand and my mike went &ndash; right on the floor</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Those must be really good answers we are giving you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah [laughter] I&rsquo;m turning red.&nbsp; You know I&rsquo;ve got these pet peeves and one of them is I&rsquo;m on all these lists and I only get people when they want to sell something and there&rsquo;s a big gap and I go &ldquo;so where were you for three months?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll never know.&nbsp; They come out and you&rsquo;re just showing so much leadership with these hangouts.&nbsp; On our December podcast we talk about honest communication and all that so I won&rsquo;t repeat it but I wanted to&nbsp; shift gears.&nbsp; You can hear me right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash/Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, yes we can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You are using&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bootstrap, from Twitter\">Bootstrap</a>&nbsp;for Anahita 1.6.&nbsp; Bootstrap is from Twitter and it says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions&rdquo;. What does it mean, and why is it attractive to you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A&amp;R:</strong>&nbsp;Because it&rsquo;s so easy to use and it provides so many new vitamins that are fabulous [laughs] and it has all you need in one spot for building web applications&hellip; to give you an example especially if you are coming from Drupal world and imagine having a web package apps and UI&nbsp; and building something.&nbsp; Building a template and maintaining it and building all the applicable GUI&rsquo;s in a CMS environment is such difficult work &ndash; it&rsquo;s very time consuming. And one of the things we wanted to do in Anahita is that this very applications oriented; it is not a CMS environment.&nbsp; Anahita needed a very powerful library to provide all the user interface elements everything that is outside the box. So Bootstrap did a marvelous job and it&rsquo;s also it follows a pattern.&nbsp; Right now Anahita we just finished incorporating Bootstrap 2.0 and it follows an OO pattern.&nbsp; We have we have actors and we have mediums and they are being used in the entire site.&nbsp; If you want to build a new application you have a lot of new elements or styling that is provided either by Bootstrap or by Anahita and again it is written using existing code the Bootstrap provides.&nbsp; Anahita&rsquo;s CSS is compressed into one file that is about 130kb, which leads to a nice download of the user interfaces and I&rsquo;m telling you &ndash; you can&rsquo;t build those user interfaces with traditional CSS code. It&rsquo;s going to be too difficult to maintain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Wow.&nbsp; Did you want to add to that Ash?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I was just going to say that the whole idea of Bootstrap is just basically a UI framework.&nbsp; You will be using frameworks for building software. There is a new concept, well it&rsquo;s not so new, but recently has been coming out since CSS3 and it&rsquo;s not the only one, there are actually other ones, other UI frameworks, basically they took the approach of software frameworks and they applied to the UI and basically they give you a box, a lego box, a box of elements and tools and a mind set on how to build; and then that&rsquo;s basically what the Bootstrap is and that&rsquo;s why it takes less time to build UI&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s the nature of the framework, just like any software framework it makes you get started really fast and do things really fast and then they also on top of this have a new way of doing CSS basically there are traditional CSS which is manually entering CSS and there is a new way of CSS uses some kind of object oriented-ness to write CSS.&nbsp; Less is one of them, there is SCSS, something like that, there are two different ones and Bootstrap uses a less which is very nice, very natural.&nbsp; But yeah, Bootstrap is basically like any other framework &ndash; it gets you started, it basically takes the thinking out of you and you can just focus on what you need to build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob</strong>: We continue with Part 2 of our interview with Ash and Rastin of Anahitopoliss.com and the Bob Bloom Show Number 51.&nbsp; In the meantime this is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.

(56, 92, 3, 'Tbbs52', '<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Welcome to the 52nd &ldquo;The Bob Bloom Show&rdquo;. My name is Bob Bloom from Toronto, Canada. Today is Thursday, April 26th, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I&rsquo;m going heads down getting LaSalleMart 1.0 out, this is my last podcast before June. Although I&rsquo;ll probably have one podcast about LaSalleMart in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I welcome back Arash Sanieyan and Rastin Mehr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today we recorded a 45 minute podcast &mdash; I wanted to keep the conversation flowing by not splitting up the interview into two 25 minute segments, which is how I prefer to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I was so caught off-guard by our topic toward the end of our interview, that I am showcasing our discussion in this separate podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southlasallemedia.com/2012/tbbs51\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Learning From Ash and Rastin, Part 1 of 2\">TBBS #51</a>&nbsp;is the first part of our interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we pick things up on the fly&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I wanted to move on, I wanted to talk about it more but I want to move on to keep to about 40 minutes.&nbsp; To talk about what you said on your last Hangout,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2012/03/anahita-podcast-episode-7/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anahita Hangout Podcast #7\">the famous Nick was in the &ldquo;toilet&rdquo; Hangout</a>. [laughter] At the 12 minute 50 second mark of the hangout Rastin said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>at some point we need to get investors involved.&nbsp; One approach we&rsquo;re going to do is to start our own start-ups, these are other projects that are built using Anahita because that is the original motive for Anahita.&nbsp; We had all these start-up ideas and none of the existing tools were good enough, so we decided to use our own platform framework</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So the whole reason to do Anahita originally was as a platform for your own start-ups?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how when Ash and I met four years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had all these different ideas to build and before that both of us had been working on several start-up projects and we realized that all of them needed some kind of social networking technology and none of the existing tools were good enough.&nbsp; We actually did a comprehensive study of all the existing frameworks and all the existing social networking out of the box solutions and we were not impressed to be honest, so we started to build it ourselves and as we were building people who heard about our projects, they were interested to use it as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So they ended up paying us to get access to the code, to get access to our chat room and everything, that&rsquo;s how the first tribe of Anahita was formed and that&rsquo;s how we actually raised quite a bit of funds for Anahita to fund the development hours and after that we started the premium plans and that&rsquo;s how the community grew.&nbsp; So even today, we build Anahita primarily based on the needs that we have right now for our projects and then we share that with other people because that&rsquo;s how we can build products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact when somebody asks us for an application or something that we are not using it ourselves, it gets quite difficult for us to develop that because we have to put ourselves in their place to understand what needs they have.&nbsp; We have to continue maintaining a technology we&rsquo;re not using ourselves, so in general, we are not as interested.&nbsp; And even today right now it&rsquo;s so much fun that we can see a lot of the ideas that we&rsquo;ve had now we can build them faster than other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You mean that you never, Anahita was never set up sort of as a product? It was always set up as a technology that you wanted to use yourself for other things?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s how it started, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not &ndash; you&rsquo;ll have to excuse the sort of extension mentality &ndash; you weren&rsquo;t building you know, I&rsquo;m only thinking of an extension as a, don&rsquo;t take that the wrong way.&nbsp; You weren&rsquo;t setting out to build an extension for Joomla or something stand alone to sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;No. That&rsquo;s a good enough motive.&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t work out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;See I&rsquo;m learning something new about you every day.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t realize that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>It comes from inside of you &ndash; the need</strong>.&nbsp; Great products were built with that motive, that you have a need, you want to do something, there isn&rsquo;t something good enough, what do you do? You get on and do it yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone say that I need to build the technology because I have these start-up ideas and then have a start-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re not the only ones.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to go far &ndash; Nooku Framework was built based on that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great product and it was built based on the same need.&nbsp; I think Steve Jobs said that if there was a good computer they would have never made Apple back then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t have any paid subscriptions for Nooku.&nbsp; I know, but you have these paid subscriptions for Anahitopolis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>It&rsquo;s for the support, it&rsquo;s for sharing the knowledge &ndash; not really for the product itself &ndash; if you notice that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s actually to create an environment for people that can share &ndash; a support group.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t charge for software.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t charge for the code.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what the subscription is for.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I can see now, it&rsquo;s such a beautiful, the whole way you&rsquo;ve gone about it is so beautiful and how you know, you do things and your site is different and it just works and I feel so connected and I can see the philosophy has always been different, and better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well, thank you for saying that.&nbsp; Yes the philosophy has always been that, I mean this is the number one reason we&rsquo;re using Anahita on Anahitopolis &ndash; yes you&rsquo;re right, there are other products that they are selling but then they started using it themselves but that&rsquo;s the philosophy.&nbsp; It was always a personal need, a personal motivation.&nbsp; Seeing people using it gives us even more reasons to do that &ndash; it just make us happier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the best feeling when you see people using Anahita and then customizing it &ndash; anything, anybody &ndash; I was on beerlovers.com and they&rsquo;re using Anahita and Scott and he&rsquo;s done a great job and I&rsquo;m very proud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Also Andy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Well Andy&rsquo;s done a tremendous job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;He&rsquo;s a very active member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, go on Rastin. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But those are things other people have started with Anahita &ndash; YOU have ideas that you want to use Anahita for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well the other thing is we like to be a role model, an example for people how to push the limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have already used Anahita in many client projects that are not even social networking but the framework is so powerful that you can even build traditional software a lot faster and more maintainable because a framework that can handle node-graph is complex scenarios of node-graph history architecture and it can have traditional models a lot easier too.&nbsp; But, we really like to start building more social networking services.&nbsp; Especially that we see a lot of projects happening around and we are like &ldquo;that is actually quite simple to build in Anahita and let&rsquo;s try building it&rdquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really fun but also we are entrepreneurs and there is nothing better, more pleasurable I suppose than building your own business with your own hands.&nbsp; That was the original motive of Anahita and it still is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>We build our own tools, our own building blocks for building business.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the nature of the times too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. But Ruby on Rails came from the same concept too, I believe.&nbsp; It was from 37 Signals they were building business solutions and Ruby on Rails came out of that which is why it became such a practical and resourceful technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So Ruby came from 37 Signals?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;It was Ruby on Rails and Ash can tell you all about it because he is a really good Ruby on Rails developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll save that for one of your Hangouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Okay [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;This is fascinating! You said at some point &ldquo;we need to get investors involved&rdquo;. So you want to get outside investors involved in building Anahita based start-ups?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. That just because what is a business? A business is an algorithm, is a box that you put, let&rsquo;s say, a $100 in and you get $300 out and that box is the business model and the next thing you need is to scale that up so you can put $100,000 in and get $300,000 out or $1,000,000 in and $3,000,000 out and that point &hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that called alchemy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well, if you&rsquo;re asking me &ndash; programming is witchcraft.&nbsp; [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You write down symbols and it&rsquo;s the forces of nature.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s what it is, once you have a business model it&rsquo;s time for investors to come to scale up the system.&nbsp; So, yes at some point you need investors to come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But right now, because the technology is new and the best way is that rather than going around trying to sell it or sell ideas, we like to build things that are impressive and build things that are just insanely great and then go and show them around and yes, so once the start-up ideas and the projects are coming out we would like to get investors too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the projects that we build using Anahita &ndash; Anahita itself is our baby, we like to keep it for as long as it goes.&nbsp; So if we get in investors for it, it will be to grow it.&nbsp; We like to become like the next Red Hat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;What is Red Hat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;The Linux distribution.&nbsp; I believe they are the first billion dollar open source company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Totally enterprise, the service is an enterprise market.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re public too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So you&rsquo;re going to have a big building in Richmond Centre? Hello &hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Hello &hellip;&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I just said, you&rsquo;re going to have to move from Yaletown to a big box office place in Richmond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Hopefully not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;I used to be there, I would never do that. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;There are big companies in Vancouver downtown that they&rsquo;re staying. Hootstreet, well they&rsquo;re not big, but they&rsquo;re bigger than us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;They&rsquo;re premium service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;They a few blocks away from us actually, so they managed to stay in Vancouver &ndash; so we would too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t consider Richmond in Vancouver? I should stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t say that. [laughter]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;The thing is I would never want to do the 9-5 working in a cubicle, working in a treadmill office environment, so &ndash; no.&nbsp; The company is going to have a completely different structure.&nbsp; I would rather it look like a nice big tribe that you go in and innovators in every corner they are working and the environment that is very human friendly and very comfortable for everybody to nurture their creativity, so then the corporate structure is not going to nurture that concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Yes Ash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;No I didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;That was me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;(big sigh) Well, that was quite an education. We&rsquo;re just a little over, I wanted to go about 40 odd minutes.&nbsp; Thank you so much for being here and for doing the show and answering all the questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re most welcome. Thank you for having us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Bob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;It was just a fabulous experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, that we were not at our best shape.&nbsp; I feel we were maybe a little bit off because really lack of sleep.&nbsp; I worked really late last night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;But you see if we did this at 2:00 in the morning you&rsquo;d say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m working&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, exactly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So we have to do it when you&rsquo;re just waking up or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;No, this is good. I don&rsquo;t care how much sleep I have &ndash; we always show up for the interviews, for your podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well you&rsquo;ve laid down a lot of lessons to learn and I learned and got some insight into how you got into the mode that you did which is different from really what I&rsquo;m used to &ndash; from traditional Joomla extension developers and you showed tremendous leadership and your blogs are very honest and you&rsquo;ve got these tidbits about how to cope with Open Source Software and how to succeed with it and it&rsquo;s sort of off the beaten path but I think that a lot of other people are off the beaten path.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I think you&rsquo;ve got the essence of it and everybody should be paying attention to what you do.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ash:</strong>&nbsp;Oh thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;In other words &ndash; I have no strong opinions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t mind opinions &ndash; in the community we get all kinds of conversation happening and yes, people do feel uncomfortable for so many rules that we break.&nbsp; But there is an intention behind it &ndash; there is a path and a goal that we decide not to do certain things and for Anahita technology it has to be flexible &ndash; it has to be able to evolve and it has to be light and lean and innovative &ndash; which means people need to be comfortable with change and one of the biggest challenges for example we&rsquo;ve had is to snap people out of their structured way of thinking and think in terms of distributed and organic models.&nbsp; Because people are still asking how I can build? And you know what we can talk about these on Friday because we have a hangout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Well I on purpose didn&rsquo;t request to sign up because I could be on all of them &ndash; I have so much fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Oh you&rsquo;re welcome to join in &ndash; that&rsquo;s why the hangouts are hangouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;I should let everybody else get a kick at the can &ndash; because it&rsquo;s a very unique experience &ndash; I think all tribe members should get in on it &ndash; without me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;Well you have a lot to contribute Bob and also we are happy to have you.&nbsp; You are the one that inspired us to have a Podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you. Actually I&rsquo;ve got other stuff on Friday. Yes &ndash; you actually changed the date to accommodate this podcast but I won&rsquo;t be able to make it on Friday anyways &ndash; but the next one I will pipe up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rastin:</strong>&nbsp;No problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;So I&rsquo;m going to sign off.&nbsp; Thank you very much. This is Bob Bloom, signing off, wishing you a profitable week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You have been listening to a SouthLaSalleMEDIA.com production.
